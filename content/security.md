# Security Pillar
The Security pillar includes the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

## Definition
There are five best practice areas for Security in the cloud:

+ Identity and access management 
+ Detective controls
+ Infrastructure protection
+ Data protection
+ Incident response

Before you architect any system, you need to think about its security implications and the practices that can affect your security posture. For example, you need to control who can perform actions against a set of resources. You also need the ability to quickly identify security incidents, protect your systems and services from unauthorized access, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. Having a well-defined and rehearsed process for responding to security incidents will help too. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.

AWS helps organizations achieve their security and compliance goals by offering a rich set of security services that have evolved based on feedback from a broad set of security conscious customers. By offering a highly secure foundation, customers can spend less time on “undifferentiated heavy lifting” and more time on achieving their business objectives. 

## Best Practices
### Identity and Access Management
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that performs 2 essential functions: Authentication and Authorization.  Authentication involves the verification of a indentity whereas authorization governs the actions that can be performed by AWS resources.  Within AWS, a resource can be another AWS service, e.g. EC2, or an AWS principle such as an IAM User or Role.  The rules governing the actions that a resource is allowed to peform are expressed as IAM policies.  

### Controlling Access to EKS Clusters
The Kubernetes project supports a variety of different strategies to authenticate requests to the kube-apiserver service, e.g. Bearer Tokens, X.509 certificates, OIDC, etc. EKS currently has native support for [webhook token authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#webhook-token-authentication) and [serivce account tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#service-account-tokens).  

The webhook authentication strategy calls a webhook that verifies bearer tokens. On EKS, these bearer tokens are generated by the AWS CLI or the [aws-iam-authenticator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator) client when you run `kubectl` commands. As you execute commands, the token is passed to the kube-apiserver which forwards it to the authentication webhook.  If the request is well-formed, the webhook calls a pre-signed URL embedded in the token's body. This URL validates the request's signature and returns information about the user, e.g. the user's account, Arn, and UserId to the kube-apiserver.  

To generate a authentication token, type the following command in a terminal window: 
```
aws eks get-token --cluster <cluster_name>
```
The output should resemble this: 
```
{"kind": "ExecCredential", "apiVersion": "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1", "spec": {}, "status": {"expirationTimestamp": "2020-02-19T16:08:27Z", "token": "k8s-aws-v1.aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS8_QWN0aW9uPUdldENhbGxlcklkZW50aXR5JlZlcnNpb249MjAxMS0wNi0xNSZYLUFtei1BbGdvcml0aG09QVdTNC1ITUFDLVNIQTI1NiZYLUFtei1DcmVkZW50aWFsPUFLSUFKTkdSSUxLTlNSQzJXNVFBJTJGMjAyMDAyMTklMkZ1cy1lYXN0LTElMkZzdHMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDIwMDIxOVQxNTU0MjdaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9NjAmWC1BbXotU2lnbmVkSGVhZGVycz1ob3N0JTNCeC1rOHMtYXdzLWlkJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT0yMjBmOGYzNTg1ZTMyMGRkYjVlNjgzYTVjOWE0MDUzMDFhZDc2NTQ2ZjI0ZjI4MTExZmRhZDA5Y2Y2NDhhMzkz"}}
```
Each token starts with `k8s-aws-v1.` followed by a base64 encoded string. The string, when decoded, should resemble this: 
```
https://sts.amazonaws.com/?Action=GetCallerIdentity&Version=2011-06-15&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJNGRILKNSRC2W5QA%2F20200219%2Fus-east-1%2Fsts%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200219T155427Z&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host%3Bx-k8s-aws-id&X-Amz-Signature=220f8f3585e320ddb5e683a5c9a405301ad76546f24f28111fdad09cf648a393
```
The token consists of a pre-signed URL that includes an Amazon credential and signature. For additional see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity.html. 

The token has a time to live (TTL) of 15 minutes after which a new token will need to be generated. This is handled automatically when you use a client like `kubectl` but if you're using the Kubernetes dashboard, you will need to generate a new token and re-authenticate every 15 minutes. 

Once the user's identity has been authenticated by the AWS IAM service, the kube-apiserver reads the `aws-auth` ConfigMap in the kube-system namespace to determine the RBAC group to associate with the user.  The `aws-auth` ConfigMap is used to create a static mapping betweeen IAM principles, i.e. IAM Users and Roles, and Kubernetes RBAC groups. RBAC groups can be referenced in Kubernetes RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings. They are similar to IAM Roles in that they define a set of actions (verbs) that can be peformed against a collection of Kubernetes resources (objects).

#### Recommendations
+ **Don't use a service account token for authentication**. A service account token is a long-lived credential. If it is compromised, lost, or stolen, an attacker may be able to perform all the actions associated with that token until the service account is deleted. You may need to grant an exception for applications that have to consume the Kubernetes API from outside the cluster, e.g. a CI/CD pipeline application. If such applications run on AWS infrastructure, like EC2 instances, consider using an instance profile and mapping that to a Kubernetes RBAC role in the aws-auth ConfigMap instead.  

+ **Employ least privileged access to AWS Resources**. An IAM User does not need to be assigned privileges to AWS resources to access the Kubernetes API. If you need to grant an IAM user access to an EKS cluster, create an entry in the `aws-auth` ConfigMap for that user that maps to a specific Kubernetes RBAC group. 

+ **Use IAM Roles when multiple users need identical access to the cluster**. Rather than creating an entry for each individual IAM User in the aws-auth ConfigMap, allow those users to assume an IAM Role and map that role to a Kubernetes RBAC group.  This will be easier to maintain, especially as the number of users that require access grows.

+ **Employ least privilieged access when creating RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings**. Like the earlier point about granting access to AWS Resources, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings should only include the set of permissions necessary to perform a specific function. Avoid using `["*"]` in your Roles and ClusterRoles unless it's absolutely necessary. If you're unsure what permissions to assign, consider using a tool like [audit2rbac](https://github.com/liggitt/audit2rbac) to automatically generate Roles and binding based on the observed API calls in the Kubernetes Audit Log.

+ **Regularly audit access to the cluster**. Who requires access is likely to change over time. Periodically review the aws-auth ConfigMap to see who has been granted access and the rights they've been assigned. You can also use open source tooling like [kubectl-who-can](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can), or [rbac-lookup](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/rbac-lookup) to examine the roles bound to a particular service account, user, or group. We'll explore this topic further when we get to the section on auditing.

+ **Make the EKS Cluster Endpoint private**. By default when you provision an EKS cluster, the API cluster endpoint is set to public, i.e. it can be accessed from the Internet. Despite being public, the endpoint is considered secure because it requires that all API requests are first authenticated and then authorized. That said, if your security policy mandates that you restrict access to the API from the Internet or prevents you from routing traffic outside the cluster VPC, you can: 
    + Configure the EKS cluster endpoint to be private. See [Modifying Cluster Endpoint Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html) for further information on this topic. 
    + Leave the cluster endpoint public and specify which CIDR blocks can communicate with the cluster endpoint. The blocks are effectively a whitelisted set of public IP addresses that are allowed to access the cluster endpoint.
    + Configure public access with a set of whitelisted CIDR blocks and set private endpoint access to enabled. This will allow public access from a specific range of public IPs while forcing all network traffic between the kubelets (workers) and the Kubernetes API through the cross-account ENIs that get provisioned into the cluster VPC when the control plane is provisioned.

#### Alternative Approaches to Authentication and Access Management
While IAM is the preferred way to authenticate users who need access to an EKS cluster, it is possible to use an OIDC identity provider such as GitHub using an authentication proxy and Kubernetes [impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation). Posts for 2 such solutions have been published on the AWS Open Source blog:
+ [Authenticating to EKS Using GitHub Credentials with Teleport](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/authenticating-eks-github-credentials-teleport/)
+ [Consistent OIDC authentication across multiple EKS clusters using kube-oidc-proxy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/consistent-oidc-authentication-across-multiple-eks-clusters-using-kube-oidc-proxy/)

You can also use [AWS SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) to federate AWS with an external identity provider, e.g. Azure AD. If you decide to use this, the AWS CLI v2.0 includes an option to create a named profile that makes it easy to associate an SSO session with your current CLI session and assume an IAM role. Know that you must assume a role prior to running `kubectl` as the IAM role is used to determine the user's Kubernetes RBAC group.

### Pods Identities
Certain applications that run within a Kubernetes cluster need permission to call the Kubernetes API to function properly. For example, the ALB Ingress Controller needs to be able to list a service's endpoints. The controller also needs to be able to invoke AWS APIs to provision and configure an ALB.  In this section we will explore the best practices for assigning rights and privileges to pods. 

#### Kubernetes Service Accounts
A service account is a special type of object that allows you to assign a Kubernetes RBAC role to a pod.  A default service account is created for each namespace within a cluster. When you deploy a pod into a namespace without referencing a specific service account, the default service account for that namespace will automatically get assigned to the pod and the secret, i.e. the service account (JWT) token for that service account, will get mounted to the pod as a volume at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`. Decoding the service account token in that directory will reveal the following metadata: 
```
{
  "iss": "kubernetes/serviceaccount",
  "kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace": "default",
  "kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/secret.name": "default-token-5pv4z",
  "kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.name": "default",
  "kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.uid": "3b36ddb5-438c-11ea-9438-063a49b60fba",
  "sub": "system:serviceaccount:default:default"
}
``` 

The default service account has the following permissions to the Kubernetes API.
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
  creationTimestamp: "2020-01-30T18:13:25Z"
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/bootstrapping: rbac-defaults
  name: system:discovery
  resourceVersion: "43"
  selfLink: /apis/rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/clusterroles/system%3Adiscovery
  uid: 350d2ab8-438c-11ea-9438-063a49b60fba
rules:
- nonResourceURLs:
  - /api
  - /api/*
  - /apis
  - /apis/*
  - /healthz
  - /openapi
  - /openapi/*
  - /version
  - /version/
  verbs:
  - get
  ```
This role authorizes unauthenticated and authenticated users to read API information and is deemed safe to be publicly accessible.

When an application running within a pod calls the Kubernetes APIs, the pod needs to be assigned a service account that grants it permission to do so.  Similar to guidelines for user access, the Role or ClusterRole bound to a service account should be restricted to the API resources and methods that the application needs to function and nothing else. To use a non-default service account simply set the `spec.serviceAccountName` field of a pod to the name of the service account you wish to use. For additional information about creating service accounts, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#service-account-permissions. 

#### IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)
IRSA is a new feature that allows you to assign an IAM role to a Kubernetes service account. It works by leveraging a Kubernetes feature known as [Service Account Token Volume Projection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection). Pods with service accounts that reference an IAM Role call a public OIDC discovery endpoint for AWS IAM upon startup. The endpoint cyrptographically signs the OIDC token issued by Kubernetes which ultimately allows the pod to call the AWS APIs associated IAM role. When an AWS API is invoked, the AWS SDKs calls `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` and automatically exchanges the Kubernetes issued token for a AWS role credential. 

Decoding the (JWT) token for IRSA will produce output similar to the example you see below: 
```
{
  "aud": [
    "sts.amazonaws.com"
  ],
  "exp": 1582306514,
  "iat": 1582220114,
  "iss": "https://oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/D43CF17C27A865987144EA99A26FB128",
  "kubernetes.io": {
    "namespace": "default",
    "pod": {
      "name": "alpine-57b5664646-rf966",
      "uid": "5a20f883-5407-11ea-a85c-0e62b7a4a436"
    },
    "serviceaccount": {
      "name": "s3-read-only",
      "uid": "a720ba5c-5406-11ea-9438-063a49b60fba"
    }
  },
  "nbf": 1582220114,
  "sub": "system:serviceaccount:default:s3-read-only"
}
```
This particular token grants the pod view-only privileges to S3. When the application attempt to read from S3, the token is exchanged for a temporary set of IAM credentials that resembles this: 
```
{
    "AssumedRoleUser": {
        "AssumedRoleId": "AROA36C6WWEJULFUYMPB6:abc", 
        "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::820537372947:assumed-role/eksctl-winterfell-addon-iamserviceaccount-de-Role1-1D61LT75JH3MB/abc"
    }, 
    "Audience": "sts.amazonaws.com", 
    "Provider": "arn:aws:iam::820537372947:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/D43CF17C27A865987144EA99A26FB128", 
    "SubjectFromWebIdentityToken": "system:serviceaccount:default:s3-read-only", 
    "Credentials": {
        "SecretAccessKey": "ORJ+8Adk+wW+nU8FETq7+mOqeA8Z6jlPihnV8hX1", 
        "SessionToken": "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",

        "AccessKeyId": "ASIA36C6WWEJUMHA3L7Z"
    }
}
```  

A mutating webhook that runs as part of the EKS control plane injects the AWS Role Arn and the path to a web identity token file into the pod as environment variables. These values can also be supplied manually. 
```
AWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/IAM_ROLE_NAME
AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE=/var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token
```

The kubelet will automatically rotate the projected token when it is older than 80% of its total TTL, or after 24 hours. The AWS SDKs are responsible for reloading the token when it rotates. For further information about IRSA, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-technical-overview.html.

#### Recommendations
+ **Disable auto-mounting of service account tokens**. If your application doesn't need to call the Kubernetes API set the `automountServiceAccountToken` attribute to `false` in the PodSec for your application or patch the default service account in each namespace so that it's no longer mounted to pods automatically. For example: 
    ```
    kubectl patch serviceaccount default -p $'automountServiceAccountToken: false'
    ```
+ **Use dedicated service accounts for each application**. Each application should have its own dedicated service account.  This applies to service accounts for the Kubernetes API as well as IRSA. 

    If you employ a blue/green approach to cluster upgrades instead of performing an in-place cluster upgrade, you will need to update the trust policy of each of the IRSA IAM roles with the OIDC endpoint of the new cluster. A blue/green cluster upgrade is where you create a cluster running a newer version of Kubernetes alongside the old cluster and use a load balancer or a service mesh to seamlessly shift traffic from services running on the old cluster to the new cluster. 

+ **Restrict access to the instance profile assigned to the worker node**. When you use IRSA, the pod no longer inherits the rights of the instance profile assigned to the worker node. Nonetheless, as an added precaution, you may want to block a process's ability to access EC2 metadata. This will effectively prevent pods that do not use IRSA from inheriting the role assigned to the worker node. Be aware that when you block access to EC2 metadata on a worker node, it may prevent certain pods from functioning properly. For additional information about how to block access to instance metadata, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/restrict-ec2-credential-access.html.

+ **Run the application as a non-root user**. Containers run as root by default. While this allows them to to read the web identity token file, running a container as root is not considered a best practice. As an alternative, consider adding the `spec.securityContext.runAsUser` attribute to the PodSpec.  The value of `runAsUser` is abritrary value.   

+ **Scope the IAM Role trust policy for IRSA to the service account name**. The trust policy can be scoped to a namespace or a specific service account within a namespace. When using IRSA it's best to make the role trust policy as explicit as possible by including the service account name. This will effectively prevent other pods within the same namespace from assuming the role. The CLI `eksctl` will do this automatically when you use it to create service accounts/IAM roles. See https://eksctl.io/usage/iamserviceaccounts/ for futher information. 

#### Alternative approaches
While IRSA is the _preferred way_ to assign an AWS "identity" to a pod, it requires that you include recent version of the AWS SDKs in your application. For a complete listing of the SDKs that currently support IRSA, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-minimum-sdk.html. If you have an application that you can't immediately update with a IRSA-compatible SDK, there are several community-built solutions available for assigning IAM roles to Kubernetes pods, including kube2iam, kiam, and iam4kube.  Although AWS doesn't endorse or condone the use of these solutions, they are frequently used by the community at large to achieve similar results as IRSA. 

## Pod Security

Pods have variety of different settings that can strengthen or weaken your overall security posture.  As a Kubernetes practitioner your chief concern should be preventing a process that’s running in a container from escaping the isolation boundaries of Docker and gaining access to the underlying host.  The reason for this is twofold.  First, the processes that run within a container run under the context of the \[Linux\] root by default.  Although the actions of root within a container are constrained by the set of Linux capabilities that Docker assigns to the containers, these default privileges could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges and/or gain access to sensitive information bound to the host, including Secrets and ConfigMaps.  Below is a list of default capabilities assigned to Docker containers.  For additional information about each capability, see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html.

`CAP_CHOWN, CAP_DAC_OVERERIDE, CAP_FOWNER, CAP_FSETID, CAP_KILL, CAP_SETGID, CAP_SETUID, CAP_SETPCAP, CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_SYS_CHROOT, CAP_MKNOD, CAP_AUDIT_WRITE, CAP_SETFCAP`

Pods that are run as privileged, inherit _all_ of the Linux capabilities associated with root on the host and should be avoided if possible.

Second, all Kubernetes worker nodes use an authorization mode called the node authorizer.  The node authorizer authorizes all API requests that originate from the kubelet and allows nodes to perform the following actions: 

Read operations:

+ services
+ endpoints
+ nodes
+ pods
+ secrets, configmaps, persistent volume claims and persistent volumes related to pods bound to the kubelet’s node

Write operations:

+ nodes and node status (enable the `NodeRestriction` admission plugin to limit a kubelet to modify its own node)
+ pods and pod status (enable the `NodeRestriction` admission plugin to limit a kubelet to modify pods bound to itself)
+ events

Auth-related operations:

+ read/write access to the certificationsigningrequests API for TLS bootstrapping
+ the ability to create tokenreviews and subjectaccessreviews for delegated authentication/authorization checks

EKS uses the [node restriction admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction) which only allows the node to modify a limited set of node attributes and pod objects that are bound to the node.   Nevertheless, an attacker who manages to get access to the host will be able to glean sensitive information about the environment from the Kubernetes API that could allow them to move laterally within the cluster.

### Recommendations

+ **Restrict the containers that can run as privileged**.  As mentioned, containers that run as privileged inherit all of the Linux capabilities assigned to root on the host.  Seldom do containers need these types of privileges to function properly.  You can reject pods with containers configured to run as privileged by creating a [pod security policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/).  You can think of a pod security policy as a set requirements that pods have to meet before they can be created.  If you elect to use pod security policies, you will need to create a role binding that allows service accounts to read your pod security policies. 

    When you provision an EKS cluster, a pod security policy called eks.privileged is automatically created.  The manifest for the policy appears below: 

    ```
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
    metadata:

    This effectively allows an authenticated user to run privileged containers across all namespaces within the cluster.  While this may seem overly permissive, there are certain applications/plug-ins such as the AWS VPC CNI and kube-proxy that have to run as privileged because they are responsible for configuring the host’s network settings. Furthermore, this policy provides backward compatibility with earlier versions of Kubernetes that lacked support for pod security policies. 

    As a best practice, however, we recommend that you scope the binding for privileged pods to service accounts within a particular namespace, e.g. kube-system, and limiting access to that namespace.  For all other serviceaccounts/namespaces, we recommend implementing a more restrictive policy such as this: 

    ```
    apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      name: restricted
      annotations:
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'docker/default,runtime/default'
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'runtime/default'
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  'runtime/default'
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  'runtime/default'
    spec:
      privileged: false
      # Required to prevent escalations to root.
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      # This is redundant with non-root + disallow privilege escalation,
      # but we can provide it for defense in depth.
      requiredDropCapabilities:
        - ALL
      # Allow core volume types.
      volumes:
        - 'configMap'
        - 'emptyDir'
        - 'projected'
        - 'secret'
        - 'downwardAPI'
        # Assume that persistentVolumes set up by the cluster admin are safe to use.
        - 'persistentVolumeClaim'
      hostNetwork: false
      hostIPC: false
      hostPID: false
      runAsUser:
        # Require the container to run without root privileges.
        rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
      seLinux:
        # This policy assumes the nodes are using AppArmor rather than SELinux.
        rule: 'RunAsAny'
      supplementalGroups:
        rule: 'MustRunAs'
        ranges:
          # Forbid adding the root group.
          - min: 1
            max: 65535
      fsGroup:
        rule: 'MustRunAs'
        ranges:
          # Forbid adding the root group.
          - min: 1
            max: 65535
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
    ```

    This policy prevents pods from running as privileged or escalating privileges.  It also restricts the types of volumes that can be mounted and the root supplemental groups that can be added. 

+ **Do not run processes in containers as root**. All containers run as root by default.  This could be problematic if an attacker is able to exploit a vulnerability in the application and get shell access to the running container.  You can mitigate this risk a variety of ways.  First, by removing the shell from the container image.  Second, adding the USER directive to your Dockerfile or running the containers in the pod as a non-root user.  The Kubernetes podSpec includes a set of fields under spec.securityContext, that allow to let you specify the user and/or group to run your application as.  These fields are `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup` respectively.  You can mandate the use of these fields by creating a pod security policy.  See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups for further information on this topic. 

+ **Restrict the use of hostPath or if hostPath is necessary restrict which prefixes can be used and configure the volume as read-only**. hostPath is a volume that mounts a directory from the host directly to the container.  Rarely will pods need this type of access, but if they do, you need to be aware of the risks.  By default pods that run as root will have write access to the file system exposed by hostPath.  This could allow an attacker to modify the kubelet settings, create symbolic links to directories or files not directly exposed by the hostPath, e.g. /etc/shadow, install an ssh keys, read secrets mounted to the host, and other malicious things. To mitigate the risks from hostPath, configure the spec.containers.volumeMounts as readOnly, for example: 

    ```
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hostPath-volume
      readOnly: true
      mountPath: /host-path
    ```
    You should also use a pod security policy to restrict the directories that can be used by hostPath volumes.  For example the following PSP excerpt only allows paths that begin with /foo.  It will prevent containers from traversing the host file system from outsude the prefix: 
    ```
    allowedHostPaths:
    # This allows "/foo", "/foo/", "/foo/bar" etc., but
    # disallows "/fool", "/etc/foo" etc.
    # "/foo/../" is never valid.
    - pathPrefix: "/foo"
      readOnly: true # only allow read-only mounts
    ```
+ **Set requests and limits for each container to avoid resource contention and DoS attacks**. A pod without requests or limits can theoretically consume all of the resources available on a host.  As additional pods are scheduled onto a node, the node may experience CPU or memory pressure which can cause the Kubelet to terminate or evict pods from the node.  While you can’t prevent this from happening altogether, setting requests and limits will help minimize resource contention and mitigate the risk from poorly written applications that consume an excessive amount of resources. 

    The podSpec allows you to specify requests and limits for CPU and memory.  CPU is considered a compressible resource because it can be oversubscribed.  Memory is incompressible, i.e. it cannot be shared among multiple containers.  

    When you specify requests for CPU or memory, you’re essentially designating the amount of _memory_ that containers are guaranteed to get.  Kubernetes aggregates the requests of all the containers in a pod to determine which node to schedule the pod onto.  If a container exceeds the requested amount of memory it may be subject to termination if there’s memory pressure on the node. 

    Limits are the maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that a container is allowed to consume and directly corresponds to the `memory.limit_in_bytes` value of the cgroup created for the container.  A container that exceeds the memory limit will be OOM killed. If a container exceeds its CPU limit, it will be throttled. 

    Kubernetes uses 3 Quality of Service (QoS) classes to prioritize the workloads running on a node.  These include: guaranteed, burstable, and best effort.  If limits and requests are not set, the pod is configured as burstable (lowest priority).  Burstable pods are the first to get killed when there is insufficient memory.  If limits are set on _all_ containers within the pod, or if the requests and limits are set to the same values, the pod is configured as guaranteed (higheest priority).  Guaranteed pods will not be killed unless they exceed their configured memory limits. If the limits and requests are configured with different values, or 1 container within the pod sets limits and the other don’t or have limits set for different resources, the pods are configured as burstable (medium priority). These pods have some resource guarantees, but can be killed once they exceed their requested memory. Be aware that requests doesn’t actually affect the `memory_limit_in_bytes` value of the cgroup; the cgroup limit is set to the amount of memory available on the host. Nevertheless, setting the requests value too low could cause the pod to be targeted for termination by the kubelet if the node undergoes memory pressure. 

    For additional information about resource QoS, see https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/node/resource-qos.md

    You can force the use of requests and limits by setting a [resource quota] (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) on a namespace or by creating a [limit range] (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/).  A resource quota allows you to specify the total amount of resources, e.g. CPU and RAM, allocated to a namespace.  When it’s applied to a namespace, it forces you to specify requests and limits for all containers deployed into that namespace. Limit ranges give you more granular control of the allocation of resources. With limit ranges you can min/max for CPU and memory resources per pod or per container within a namespace.  You can also use them to set default request/limit values if none are provided.  

+ **Do not allow privileged escalation**. Privileged escalation allows a process to change the security context under which its running.  Sudo is a good example of this or frankly any binary with the SETUID or SETGID flag.  Privileged escalation is basically a way for users to execute a file with the permissions of another user or group.  You can prevent a container from privileged by implementing a pod security policy that sets `allowPriviledgedEscalation` to false or by setting `securityContext.allowPrivilegedEscalation` in the podSpec.  

## Image security

**Remove extraneous binaries from the container image**.

# Compliance

Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the consumers of its services. Generally speaking, AWS is responsible for “security of the cloud” whereas its users are responsible for “security in the cloud.” The line that delineates what AWS and its users are responsible for will vary depending on the service. For example, with Fargate, AWS is responsible for managing the physical security of its data centers, the hardware, the virtual infrastructure (Amazon EC2), and the container runtime (Docker). Users of Fargate are responsible for securing the container image and their application. Knowing who is responsible for what is an important consideration when running workloads that must adhere to compliance standards.

The following table shows the compliance programs with which the different container services conform.

## Shifting Left

The concept of shifting left involves catching policy violations and errors earlier in the software development lifecycle. From a security perspective, this can be very beneficial. A developer, for example, can fix issues with their configuration before their application is deployed to the cluster. Catching mistakes like this earlier will help prevent configurations that violate your policies from being deployed.

### Policy as Code

Policy can be thought of as a set of rules for governing behaviors, i.e. behaviors that are allowed or those that are prohibited. For example, you may have a policy that says that all Dockerfiles should include a USER directive that causes the container to run as a non-root user. As a document, a policy like this can be hard to discover and enforce. It may also become outdated as your requirements change. With Policy as Code (PaC) solutions, you can automate security, compliance, and privacy controls that detect, prevent, reduce, and counteract known and persistent threats. Furthermore, they give you mechanism to codify your policies and manage them as you do other code artifacts. The benefit of this approach is that you can reuse your DevOps and GitOps strategies to manage and consistently apply policies across fleets of Kubernetes clusters. Please refer to [Pod Security](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/pods/#pod-security) for information about PaC options and the future of PSPs.

## Recommendations

### Use policy-as-code tools in pipelines to detect violations before deployment

[OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) is an open source policy engine that's part of the CNCF. It's used for making policy decisions and can be run a variety of different ways, e.g. as a language library or a service. OPA policies are written in a Domain Specific Language (DSL) called Rego. While it is often run as part of a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller as the [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) project, OPA can also be incorporated into your CI/CD pipeline. This allows developers to get feedback about their configuration earlier in the release cycle which can subsequently help them resolve issues before they get to production. A collection of common OPA policies can be found in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-eks-best-practices/tree/master/policies/opa) for this project.

+ [Conftest](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest) is built on top of OPA and it provides a developer focused experience for testing Kubernetes configuration.
+ [sKan](https://github.com/alcideio/skan) is powered by OPA and is "tailor made" to check whether their Kubernetes configuration files are compliant with security and operational best practices.

[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources plus ensure OCI image supply chain security. The [Kyverno CLI](https://kyverno.io/docs/kyverno-cli/) can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline. All the Kyverno community policies can be found on the [Kyverno website](https://kyverno.io/policies/), and for examples using the Kyverno CLI to write tests in pipelines, see the [policies repository](https://github.com/kyverno/policies).

[Datree](https://github.com/datreeio/datree) is a native Kubernetes solution for centralized policy management. When K8s resources are pushed into a cluster, Datree checks their configurations against pre-defined policies. As soon as misconfigurations are detected, Datree displays a detailed output of their location and impact, along with instructions on how to fix them and based on its settings, Datree can both audit and prevent resources that contains violations from being applied.
Additionally, Datree can be integrated into the CI pipeline as a “shift-left” tool for development teams. By identifying misconfigurations in the early stages of the development cycle and providing guidelines for fixing them Datree helps dev teams comply with new policies and ensures that only configurations that meet the desired standards are included in the codebase.
You can use Datree to regularly scan the cluster for policy violations, monitor and enforce pod and network security policies, build a policy that runs pods from different tenants on different instances, and make sure you follow other EKS best practices.
Several examples are included in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/tree/main/examples) of this project, and many others are included in the [Datree built-in policy for EKS](https://hub.datree.io/built-in-rules/rules/#EKS).

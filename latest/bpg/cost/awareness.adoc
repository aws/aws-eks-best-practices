Expenditure awareness is understanding who, where and what is causing expenditures in your EKS cluster. Getting an accurate picture of this data will help raise awareness of your spend and highlight areas to remediate.

== Recommendations

=== Use Cost Explorer

https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/[AWS Cost Explorer] has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. You can analyze cost and usage data, at various levels using the filters available in Cost Explorer.

==== EKS Control Plane and EKS Fargate costs

Using the filters, we can query the costs incurred for the EKS costs at the Control Plane and Fargate Pod as shown in the diagram below:

image::eks-controlplane-costexplorer.png[Cost Explorer - EKS Control Plane]

Using the filters, we can query the aggregate costs incurred for the Fargate Pods across regions in EKS - which includes both vCPU-Hours per CPU and GB Hrs as shown in the diagram below:

image::eks-fargate-costexplorer.png[Cost Explorer - EKS Fargate]

==== Tagging of Resources

Amazon EKS supports https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-using-tags.html[adding AWS tags] to your Amazon EKS clusters. This makes it easy to control access to the EKS API for managing your clusters. Tags added to an EKS cluster are specific to the AWS EKS cluster resource, they do not propagate to other AWS resources used by the cluster such as EC2 instances or load balancers. Today, cluster tagging is supported for all new and existing EKS clusters via the AWS API, Console, and SDKs.

AWS Fargate is a technology that provides on-demand, right-sized compute capacity for containers. Before you can schedule pods on Fargate in your cluster, you must define at least one Fargate profile that specifies which pods should use Fargate when they are launched.

Adding and Listing tags to an EKS cluster:

 $ aws eks tag-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:xxx:cluster/ekscluster1 --tags team=devops,env=staging,bu=cio,costcenter=1234
 $ aws eks list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:xxx:cluster/ekscluster1
 {
     "tags": {
         "bu": "cio",
         "env": "staging",
         "costcenter": "1234",
         "team": "devops"
     }
 }

After you activate cost allocation tags in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html[AWS Cost Explorer], AWS uses the cost allocation tags to organize your resource costs on your cost allocation report, to make it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs.

Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon EKS and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. For example, you can define a set of tags for your Amazon EKS clusters to help you track each cluster's owner and stack level.

=== Use AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor offers a rich set of best practice checks and recommendations across five categories: cost optimization; security; fault tolerance; performance; and service limits.

For Cost Optimization, Trusted Advisor helps eliminate unused and idle resources and recommends making commitments to reserved capacity. The key action items that will help Amazon EKS will be around low utilsed EC2 instances, unassociated Elastic IP addresses, Idle Load Balancers, underutilized EBS volumes among other things. The complete list of checks are provided at https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/.

The Trusted Advisor also provides Savings Plans and Reserved Instances recommendations for EC2 instances and Fargate which allows you to commit to a consistent usage amount in exchange for discounted rates.

[NOTE]
====
The recommendations from Trusted Advisor are generic recommendations and not specific to EKS.

=== Use the Kubernetes dashboard

*_Kubernetes dashboard_*

Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters, which provides information about the Kubernetes cluster including the resource usage at a cluster, node and pod level. The deployment of the Kubernetes dashboard on an Amazon EKS cluster is described in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dashboard-tutorial.html[Amazon EKS documentation].

Dashboard provides resource usage breakdowns for each node and pod, as well as detailed metadata about pods, services, Deployments, and other Kubernetes objects. This consolidated information provides visibility into your Kubernetes environment.

image::kubernetes-dashboard.png[Kubernetes Dashboard]

*_kubectl top and describe commands_*

Viewing resource usage metrics with kubectl top and kubectl describe commands. kubectl top will show current CPU and memory usage for the pods or nodes across your cluster, or for a specific pod or node. The kubectl describe command will give more detailed information about a specific node or a pod.

 $ kubectl top pods
 $ kubectl top nodes
 $ kubectl top pod pod-name --namespace mynamespace --containers

Using the top command, the output will display the total amount of CPU (in cores) and memory (in MiB) that the node is using, and the percentages of the node's allocatable capacity those numbers represent. You can then drill-down to the next level, container level within pods by adding a _--containers_ flag.

 $ kubectl describe node <node>
 $ kubectl describe pod <pod>

_kubectl describe_ returns the percent of total available capacity that each resource request or limit represents.

kubectl top and describe, track the utilization and availability of critical resources such as CPU, memory, and storage across kubernetes pods, nodes and containers. This awareness will help in understanding resource usage and help in controlling costs.

=== Use CloudWatch Container Insights

Use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html[CloudWatch Container Insights] to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Container Insights is available for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service on EC2, and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2. The metrics include utilization for resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network.

The installation of insights is given in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html[documentation].

CloudWatch creates aggregated metrics at the cluster, node, pod, task, and service level as CloudWatch metrics.

*The following query shows a list of nodes, sorted by average node CPU utilization*

----
STATS avg(node_cpu_utilization) as avg_node_cpu_utilization by NodeName
| SORT avg_node_cpu_utilization DESC
----

*CPU usage by Container name*

----
stats pct(container_cpu_usage_total, 50) as CPUPercMedian by kubernetes.container_name
| filter Type="Container"
----

*Disk usage by Container name*

----
stats floor(avg(container_filesystem_usage/1024)) as container_filesystem_usage_avg_kb by InstanceId, kubernetes.container_name, device
| filter Type="ContainerFS"
| sort container_filesystem_usage_avg_kb desc
----

More sample queries are given in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-view-metrics.html[Container Insights documention]

This awareness will help in understanding resource usage and help in controlling costs.

=== Using Kubecost for expenditure awareness and guidance

Third party tools like https://kubecost.com/[kubecost] can also be deployed on Amazon EKS to get visibility into cost of running your Kubernetes cluster. Please refer to this https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/how-to-track-costs-in-multi-tenant-amazon-eks-clusters-using-kubecost/[AWS blog] for tracking costs using Kubecost

== Other tools

=== Kubernetes Garbage Collection

The role of the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/[Kubernetes garbage collector] is to delete certain objects that once had an owner, but no longer have an owner.

=== Fargate count

https://github.com/mreferre/fargatecount[Fargatecount] is an useful tool, which allows AWS customers to track, with a custom CloudWatch metric, the total number of EKS pods that have been deployed on Fargate in a specific region of a specific account. This helps in keeping track of all the Fargate pods running across an EKS cluster.

=== Popeye - A Kubernetes Cluster Sanitizer

https://github.com/derailed/popeye[Popeye - A Kubernetes Cluster Sanitizer] is a utility that scans live Kubernetes cluster and reports potential issues with deployed resources and configurations. It sanitizes your cluster based on what's deployed and not what's sitting on disk. By scanning your cluster, it detects misconfigurations and helps you to ensure that best practices are in place

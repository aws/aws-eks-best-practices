Your customers expect your application to be always available, including
when you’re making changes and especially during spikes in traffic. A
scalable and resilient architecture keeps your applications and services
running without disruptions, which keeps your users happy. A scalable
infrastructure grows and shrinks based on the needs of the business.
Eliminating single points of failure is a critical step towards
improving an application’s availability and making it resilient.

With Kubernetes, you can operate your applications and run them in a
highly-available and resilient fashion. Its declarative management
ensures that once you’ve set up the application, Kubernetes will
continuously try to
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/#desired-vs-current[match
the current state with the desired state].

== Recommendations

=== Avoid running singleton Pods

If your entire application runs in a single Pod, then your application
will be unavailable if that Pod gets terminated. Instead of deploying
applications using individual pods, create
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployments].
If a Pod that is created by a Deployment fails or gets terminated, the
Deployment
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/[controller]
will start a new pod to ensure the specified number of replica Pods are
always running.

=== Run multiple replicas

Running multiple replicas Pods of an app using a Deployment helps it run
in a highly-available manner. If one replica fails, the remaining
replicas will still function, albeit at reduced capacity until
Kubernetes creates another Pod to make up for the loss. Furthermore, you
can use the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler] to scale replicas automatically based on workload
demand.

=== Schedule replicas across nodes

Running multiple replicas won’t be very useful if all the replicas are
running on the same node, and the node becomes unavailable. Consider
using pod anti-affinity or pod topology spread constraints to spread
replicas of a Deployment across multiple worker nodes.

You can further improve a typical application’s reliability by running
it across multiple AZs.

==== Using Pod anti-affinity rules

The manifest below tells Kubernetes scheduler to _prefer_ to place pods
on separate nodes and AZs. It doesn’t require distinct nodes or AZ
because if it did, then Kubernetes will not be able to schedule any pods
once there is a pod running in each AZ. If your application requires
just three replicas, you can use
`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` for
`topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone`, and Kubernetes scheduler
will not schedule two pods in the same AZ.

==== Using Pod topology spread constraints

Similar to pod anti-affinity rules, pod topology spread constraints
allow you to make your application available across different failure
(or topology) domains like hosts or AZs. This approach works very well
when you’re trying to ensure fault tolerance as well as availability by
having multiple replicas in each of the different topology domains. Pod
anti-affinity rules, on the other hand, can easily produce a result
where you have a single replica in a topology domain because the pods
with an anti-affinity toward each other have a repelling effect. In such
cases, a single replica on a dedicated node isn’t ideal for fault
tolerance nor is it a good use of resources. With topology spread
constraints, you have more control over the spread or distribution that
the scheduler should try to apply across the topology domains. Here are
some important properties to use in this approach: 

. The `maxSkew` is
used to control or determine the maximum point to which things can be
uneven across the topology domains. For example, if an application has
10 replicas and is deployed across 3 AZs, you can’t get an even spread,
but you can influence how uneven the distribution will be. In this case,
the `maxSkew` can be anything between 1 and 10. A value of 1 means you
can potentially end up with a spread like `4,3,3`, `3,4,3` or
`3,3,4` across the 3 AZs. In contrast, a value of 10 means you can
potentially end up with a spread like `10,0,0`, `0,10,0` or
`0,0,10` across 3 AZs. 
. The `topologyKey` is a key for one of the
node labels and defines the type of topology domain that should be used
for the pod distribution. For example, a zonal spread would have the
following key-value pair:
+
....
topologyKey: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
....
+
. The `whenUnsatisfiable` property is used to determine how you want
the scheduler to respond if the desired constraints can’t be satisfied.
. The `labelSelector` is used to find matching pods so that the
scheduler can be aware of them when deciding where to place pods in
accordance with the constraints that you specify.

In addition to these above, there are other fields that you can read
about further in the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/[Kubernetes
documentation].

=== Run Kubernetes Metrics Server

Install the Kubernetes
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server[metrics server] to
help scale your applications. Kubernetes autoscaler add-ons like
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[HPA]
and
https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler[VPA]
need to track metrics of applications to scale them. The metrics-server
collects resource metrics that can be used to make scaling decisions.
The metrics are collected from kubelets and served in
https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics[Metrics API format].

The metrics server doesn’t retain any data, and it’s not a monitoring
solution. Its purpose is to expose CPU and memory usage metrics to other
systems. If you want to track your application’s state over time, you
need a monitoring tool like Prometheus or Amazon CloudWatch.

Follow the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/metrics-server.html[EKS
documentation] to install metrics-server in your EKS cluster.

== Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

HPA can automatically scale your application in response to demand and
help you avoid impacting your customers during peak traffic. It is
implemented as a control loop in Kubernetes that periodically queries
metrics from APIs that provide resource metrics.

HPA can retrieve metrics from the following APIs: 1. `metrics.k8s.io`
also known as Resource Metrics API — Provides CPU and memory usage for
pods 2. `custom.metrics.k8s.io` — Provides metrics from other metric
collectors like Prometheus; these metrics are *internal* to your
Kubernetes cluster. 3. `external.metrics.k8s.io` — Provides metrics
that are *external* to your Kubernetes cluster (E.g., SQS Queue Depth,
ELB latency).

You must use one of these three APIs to provide the metric to scale your
application.

=== Scaling applications based on custom or external metrics

You can use custom or external metrics to scale your application on
metrics other than CPU or memory utilization.
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/custom-metrics-apiserver[Custom
Metrics] API servers provide the `custom-metrics.k8s.io` API that HPA
can use to autoscale applications.

You can use the
https://github.com/directxman12/k8s-prometheus-adapter[Prometheus
Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs] to collect metrics from Prometheus
and use with the HPA. In this case, Prometheus adapter will expose
Prometheus metrics in
https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics/blob/master/pkg/apis/metrics/types.go[Metrics
API format].

Once you deploy the Prometheus Adapter, you can query custom metrics
using kubectl. `kubectl get —raw /apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/`

External metrics, as the name suggests, provide the Horizontal Pod
Autoscaler the ability to scale deployments using metrics that are
external to the Kubernetes cluster. For example, in batch processing
workloads, it is common to scale the number of replicas based on the
number of jobs in flight in an SQS queue.

To autoscale Kubernetes workloads you can use KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling), an open-source project that can drive container scaling based on a number of custom events. This https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/autoscaling-kubernetes-workloads-with-keda-using-amazon-managed-service-for-prometheus-metrics/[AWS blog] outlines how to use Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus for Kubernetes workload auto-scaling.

== Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)

VPA automatically adjusts the CPU and memory reservation for your Pods
to help you "`right-size`" your applications. For applications that need
to be scaled vertically - which is done by increasing resource
allocation - you can use
https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler[VPA]
to automatically scale Pod replicas or provide scaling recommendations.

Your application may become temporarily unavailable if VPA needs to
scale it because VPA’s current implementation does not perform in-place
adjustments to Pods; instead, it will recreate the Pod that needs to be
scaled.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/vertical-pod-autoscaler.html[EKS
Documentation] includes a walkthrough for setting up VPA.

https://github.com/FairwindsOps/goldilocks/[Fairwinds Goldilocks]
project provides a dashboard to visualize VPA recommendations for CPU
and memory requests and limits. Its VPA update mode allows you to
auto-scale Pods based on VPA recommendations.

== Updating applications

Modern applications require rapid innovation with a high degree of
stability and availability. Kubernetes gives you the tools to update
your applications continuously without disrupting your customers.

Let’s look at some of the best practices that make it possible to
quickly deploy changes without sacrificing availability.

=== Have a mechanism to perform rollbacks

Having an undo button can evade disasters. It is a best practice to test
deployments in a separate lower environment (test or development
environment) before updating the production cluster. Using a CI/CD
pipeline can help you automate and test deployments. With a continuous
deployment pipeline, you can quickly revert to the older version if the
upgrade happens to be defective.

You can use Deployments to update a running application. This is
typically done by updating the container image. You can use `kubectl`
to update a Deployment like this:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl --record deployment.apps/nginx-deployment set image nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
----

The `--record` argument record the changes to the Deployment and helps
you if you need to perform a rollback.
`kubectl rollout history deployment` shows you the recorded changes to
Deployments in your cluster. You can rollback a change using
`kubectl rollout undo deployment <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>`.

By default, when you update a Deployment that requires a recreation of
pods, Deployment will perform a
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/[rolling
update]. In other words, Kubernetes will only update a portion of the
running pods in a Deployment and not all the Pods at once. You can
control how Kubernetes performs rolling updates through
`RollingUpdateStrategy` property.

When performing a _rolling update_ of a Deployment, you can use the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#max-unavailable[`Max Unavailable`]
property to specify the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable
during the update. The `Max Surge` property of Deployment allows you
to set the maximum number of Pods that can be created over the desired
number of Pods.

Consider adjusting `max unavailable` to ensure that a rollout doesn’t
disrupt your customers. For example, Kubernetes sets 25%
`max unavailable` by default, which means if you have 100 Pods, you
may have only 75 Pods actively working during a rollout. If your
application needs a minimum of 80 Pods, this rollout can be disruptive.
Instead, you can set `max unavailable` to 20% to ensure that there are
at least 80 functional Pods throughout the rollout.

=== Use blue/green deployments

Changes are inherently risky, but changes that cannot be undone can be
potentially catastrophic. Change procedures that allow you to
effectively turn back time through a _rollback_ make enhancements and
experimentation safer. Blue/green deployments give you a method to
quickly retract the changes if things go wrong. In this deployment
strategy, you create an environment for the new version. This
environment is identical to the current version of the application being
updated. Once the new environment is provisioned, traffic is routed to
the new environment. If the new version produces the desired results
without generating errors, the old environment is terminated. Otherwise,
traffic is restored to the old version.

You can perform blue/green deployments in Kubernetes by creating a new
Deployment that is identical to the existing version’s Deployment. Once
you verify that the Pods in the new Deployment are running without
errors, you can start sending traffic to the new Deployment by changing
the `selector` spec in the Service that routes traffic to your
application’s Pods.

Many continuous integration tools such as https://fluxcd.io[Flux],
https://www.jenkins.io[Jenkins], and https://spinnaker.io[Spinnaker] let
you automate blue/green deployments. AWS Containers Blog includes a
walkthrough using AWS Load Balancer Controller:
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-aws-load-balancer-controller-for-blue-green-deployment-canary-deployment-and-a-b-testing/[Using
AWS Load Balancer Controller for blue/green deployment&#44; canary
deployment and A/B testing]

=== Use Canary deployments

Canary deployments are a variant of blue/green deployments that can
significantly remove risk from changes. In this deployment strategy, you
create a new Deployment with fewer Pods alongside your old Deployment,
and divert a small percentage of traffic to the new Deployment. If
metrics indicate that the new version is performing as well or better
than the existing version, you progressively increase traffic to the new
Deployment while scaling it up until all traffic is diverted to the new
Deployment. If there’s an issue, you can route all traffic to the old
Deployment and stop sending traffic to the new Deployment.

Although Kubernetes offers no native way to perform canary deployments,
you can use tools such as https://github.com/weaveworks/flagger[Flagger]
with
https://docs.flagger.app/tutorials/istio-progressive-delivery[Istio] or
https://docs.flagger.app/install/flagger-install-on-eks-appmesh[App
Mesh].

== Health checks and self-healing

No software is bug-free, but Kubernetes can help you to minimize the
impact of software failures. In the past, if an application crashed,
someone had to remediate the situation by restarting the application
manually. Kubernetes gives you the ability to detect software failures
in your Pods and automatically replace them with new replicas. With
Kubernetes you can monitor the health of your applications and
automatically replace unhealthy instances.

Kubernetes supports three types of
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/[health-checks]:

[arabic]
. Liveness probe
. Startup probe (supported in Kubernetes version 1.16+)
. Readiness probe

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[Kubelet],
the Kubernetes agent, is responsible for running all the above-mentioned
checks. Kubelet can check a Pods’ health in three ways: kubelet can
either run a shell command inside a Pod’s container, send an HTTP GET
request to its container, or open a TCP socket on a specified port.

If you choose an `exec`-based probe, which runs a shell script inside
a container, ensure that the shell command exits _before_ the
`timeoutSeconds` value expires. Otherwise, your node will have
`<defunct>` processes, leading to node failure.

== Recommendations

=== Use Liveness Probe to remove unhealthy pods

The Liveness probe can detect _deadlock_ conditions where the process
continues to run, but the application becomes unresponsive. For example,
if you are running a web service that listens on port 80, you can
configure a Liveness probe to send an HTTP GET request on Pod’s port 80.
Kubelet will periodically send a GET request to the Pod and expect a
response; if the Pod responds between 200-399 then the kubelet considers
that Pod is healthy; otherwise, the Pod will be marked as unhealthy. If
a Pod fails health-checks continuously, the kubelet will terminate it.

You can use `initialDelaySeconds` to delay the first probe.

When using the Liveness Probe, ensure that your application doesn’t run
into a situation in which all Pods simultaneously fail the Liveness
Probe because Kubernetes will try to replace all your Pods, which will
render your application offline. Furthermore, Kubernetes will continue
to create new Pods that will also fail Liveness Probes, putting
unnecessary strain on the control plane. Avoid configuring the Liveness
Probe to depend on an a factor that is external to your Pod, for
example, a external database. In other words, a non-responsive
external-to-your-Pod database shouldn’t make your Pods fail their
Liveness Probes.

Sandor Szücs’s post
https://srcco.de/posts/kubernetes-liveness-probes-are-dangerous.html[LIVENESS
PROBES ARE DANGEROUS] describes problems that can be caused by
misconfigured probes.

=== Use Startup Probe for applications that take longer to start

When your app needs additional time to startup, you can use the Startup
Probe to delay the Liveness and Readiness Probe. For example, a Java app
that needs to hydrate cache from a database may need up to two minutes
before it is fully functional. Any Liveness or Readiness Probe until it
becomes fully functional might fail. Configuring a Startup Probe will
allow the Java app to become _healthy_ before Liveness or Readiness
Probe are executed.

Until the Startup Probe succeeds, all the other Probes are disabled. You
can define the maximum time Kubernetes should wait for application
startup. If, after the maximum configured time, the Pod still fails
Startup Probes, it will be terminated, and a new Pod will be created.

The Startup Probe is similar to the Liveness Probe – if they fail, the
Pod is recreated. As Ricardo A. explains in his post
https://medium.com/swlh/fantastic-probes-and-how-to-configure-them-fef7e030bd2f[Fantastic
Probes And How To Configure Them], Startup Probes should be used when
the startup time of an application is unpredictable. If you know your
application needs ten seconds to start, you should use
Liveness/Readiness Probe with `initialDelaySeconds` instead.

=== Use Readiness Probe to detect partial unavailability

While the Liveness probe detects failures in an app that are resolved by
terminating the Pod (hence, restarting the app), Readiness Probe detects
conditions where the app may be _temporarily_ unavailable. In these
situations, the app may become temporarily unresponsive; however, it is
expected to be healthy again once this operation completes.

For example, during intense disk I/O operations, applications may be
temporarily unavailable to handle requests. Here, terminating the
application’s Pod is not a remedy; at the same time, additional requests
sent to the Pod can fail.

You can use the Readiness Probe to detect temporary unavailability in
your app and stop sending requests to its Pod until it becomes
functional again. _Unlike Liveness Probe, where a failure would result
in a recreation of Pod, a failed Readiness Probe would mean that Pod
will not receive any traffic from Kubernetes Service_. When the
Readiness Probe succeeds, Pod will resume receiving traffic from
Service.

Just like the Liveness Probe, avoid configuring Readiness Probes that
depend on a resource that’s external to the Pod (such as a database).
Here’s a scenario where a poorly configured Readiness can render the
application nonfunctional - if a Pod’s Readiness Probe fails when the
app’s database is unreachable, other Pod replicas will also fail
simultaneously since they share the same health-check criteria. Setting
the probe in this way will ensure that whenever the database is
unavailable, the Pod’s Readiness Probes will fail, and Kubernetes will
stop sending traffic _all_ Pods.

A side-effect of using Readiness Probes is that they can increase the
time it takes to update Deployments. New replicas will not receive
traffic unless Readiness Probes are successful; until then, old replicas
will continue to receive traffic.

== Dealing with disruptions

Pods have a finite lifetime - even if you have long-running Pods, it’s
prudent to ensure Pods terminate correctly when the time comes.
Depending on your upgrade strategy, Kubernetes cluster upgrades may
require you to create new worker nodes, which requires all Pods to be
recreated on newer nodes. Proper termination handling and Pod Disruption
Budgets can help you avoid service disruptions as Pods are removed from
older nodes and recreated on newer nodes.

The preferred way to upgrade worker nodes is by creating new worker
nodes and terminating old ones. Before terminating worker nodes, you
should `drain` it. When a worker node is drained, all its pods are
_safely_ evicted. Safely is a key word here; when pods on a worker are
evicted, they are not simply sent a `SIGKILL` signal. Instead, a
`SIGTERM` signal is sent to the main process (PID 1) of each container
in the Pods being evicted. After the `SIGTERM` signal is sent,
Kubernetes will give the process some time (grace period) before a
`SIGKILL` signal is sent. This grace period is 30 seconds by default;
you can override the default by using `grace-period` flag in kubectl
or declare `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` in your Podspec.

`kubectl delete pod <pod name> —grace-period=<seconds>`

It is common to have containers in which the main process doesn’t have
PID 1. Consider this Python-based sample container:

....
$ kubectl exec python-app -it ps
 PID USER TIME COMMAND
 1   root 0:00 {script.sh} /bin/sh ./script.sh
 5   root 0:00 python app.py
....

In this example, the shell script receives `SIGTERM`, the main
process, which happens to be a Python application in this example,
doesn’t get a `SIGTERM` signal. When the Pod is terminated, the Python
application will be killed abruptly. This can be remediated by changing
the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint[`ENTRYPOINT`]
of the container to launch the Python application. Alternatively, you
can use a tool like https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init[dumb-init] to
ensure that your application can handle signals.

You can also use
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks[Container
hooks] to execute a script or an HTTP request at container start or
stop. The `PreStop` hook action runs before the container receives a
`SIGTERM` signal and must complete before this signal is sent. The
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` value applies from when the
`PreStop` hook action begins executing, not when the `SIGTERM`
signal is sent.

== Recommendations

=== Protect critical workload with Pod Disruption Budgets

Pod Disruption Budget or PDB can temporarily halt the eviction process
if the number of replicas of an application falls below the declared
threshold. The eviction process will continue once the number of
available replicas is over the threshold. You can use PDB to declare the
`minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable` number of replicas. For example,
if you want at least three copies of your app to be available, you can
create a PDB.

....
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-svc-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-svc
....

The above PDB policy tells Kubernetes to halt the eviction process until
three or more replicas are available. Node draining respects
`PodDisruptionBudgets`. During an EKS managed node group upgrade,
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-update-behavior.html[nodes
are drained with a fifteen-minute timeout]. After fifteen minutes, if
the update is not forced (the option is called Rolling update in the EKS
console), the update fails. If the update is forced, the pods are
deleted.

For self-managed nodes, you can also use tools like
https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler[AWS Node Termination
Handler], which ensures that the Kubernetes control plane responds
appropriately to events that can cause your EC2 instance to become
unavailable, such as
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html[EC2
maintenance] events and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html[EC2
Spot interruptions]. It uses the Kubernetes API to cordon the node to
ensure no new Pods are scheduled, then drains it, terminating any
running Pods.

You can use Pod anti-affinity to schedule a Deployment‘s Pods on
different nodes and avoid PDB related delays during node upgrades.

=== Practice chaos engineering

Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed
system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to
withstand turbulent conditions in production.

In his blog, Dominik Tornow explains that
https://medium.com/@dominik.tornow/the-mechanics-of-kubernetes-ac8112eaa302[Kubernetes
is a declarative system] where "`__the user supplies a representation of
the desired state of the system to the system. The system then considers
the current state and the desired state to determine the sequence of
commands to transition from the current state to the desired state.__`"
This means Kubernetes always stores the _desired state_ and if the
system deviates, Kubernetes will take action to restore the state. For
example, if a worker node becomes unavailable, Kubernetes will
reschedule the Pods onto another worker node. Similarly, if a
`replica` crashes, the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/#design[Deployment
Contoller] will create a new `replica`. In this way, Kubernetes
controllers automatically fix failures.

Chaos engineering tools like https://www.gremlin.com[Gremlin] help you
test the resiliency of your Kubernetes cluster and identify single
points of failure. Tools that introduce artificial chaos in your cluster
(and beyond) can uncover systemic weaknesses, present an opportunity to
identify bottlenecks and misconfigurations, and rectify problems in a
controlled environment. The Chaos Engineering philosophy advocates
breaking things on purpose and stress testing infrastructure to minimize
unanticipated downtime.

=== Use a Service Mesh

You can use a service mesh to improve your application’s resiliency.
Service meshes enable service-to-service communication and increase the
observability of your microservices network. Most service mesh products
work by having a small network proxy run alongside each service that
intercepts and inspects the application’s network traffic. You can place
your application in a mesh without modifying your application. Using
service proxy’s built-in features, you can have it generate network
statistics, create access logs, and add HTTP headers to outbound
requests for distributed tracing.

A service mesh can help you make your microservices more resilient with
features like automatic request retries, timeouts, circuit-breaking, and
rate-limiting.

If you operate multiple clusters, you can use a service mesh to enable
cross-cluster service-to-service communication.

=== Service Meshes

* https://www.consul.io[Consul]

'''''

== Observability

Observability is an umbrella term that includes monitoring, logging, and
tracing. Microservices based applications are distributed by nature.
Unlike monolithic applications where monitoring a single system is
sufficient, in a distributed application architecture, you need to
monitor each component’s performance. You can use cluster-level
monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing systems to identify issues
in your cluster before they disrupt your customers.

Kubernetes built-in tools for troubleshooting and monitoring are
limited. The metrics-server collects resource metrics and stores them in
memory but doesn’t persist them. You can view the logs of a Pod using
kubectl, but Kubernetes doesn’t automatically retain logs. And the
implementation of distributed tracing is done either at the application
code level or using services meshes.

Kubernetes’ extensibility shines here. Kubernetes allows you to bring
your preferred centralized monitoring, logging, and tracing solution.

== Recommendations

=== Monitor your applications

The number of metrics you need to monitor in modern applications is
growing continuously. It helps if you have an automated way to track
your applications so you can focus on solving your customer’s
challenges. Cluster-wide monitoring tools like
https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] or
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html[CloudWatch
Container Insights] can monitor your cluster and workload and provide
you signals when, or preferably, before things go wrong.

Monitoring tools allow you to create alerts that your operations team
can subscribe to. Consider rules to activate alarms for events that can,
when exacerbated, lead to an outage or impact application performance.

If you’re unclear on which metrics you should monitor, you can take
inspiration from these methods:

* https://www.weave.works/blog/a-practical-guide-from-instrumenting-code-to-specifying-alerts-with-the-red-method[RED
method]. Stands for requests, errors, and duration.
* http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html[USE method]. Stands for
utilization, saturation, and errors.

Sysdig’s post https://sysdig.com/blog/alerting-kubernetes/[Best
practices for alerting on Kubernetes] includes a comprehensive list of
components that can impact the availability of your applications.

=== Use Prometheus client library to expose application metrics

In addition to monitoring the state of the application and aggregating
standard metrics, you can also use the
https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/[Prometheus client
library] to expose application-specific custom metrics to improve the
application’s observability.

=== Use centralized logging tools to collect and persist logs

Logging in EKS falls under two categories: control plane logs and
application logs. EKS control plane logging provides audit and
diagnostic logs directly from the control plane to CloudWatch Logs in
your account. Application logs are logs produced by Pods running inside
your cluster. Application logs include logs produced by Pods that run
the business logic applications and Kubernetes system components such as
CoreDNS, Cluster Autoscaler, Prometheus, etc.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html[EKS
provide five types of control plane logs]:

[arabic]
. Kubernetes API server component logs
. Audit
. Authenticator
. Controller manager
. Scheduler

The controller manager and scheduler logs can help diagnose control
plane problems such as bottlenecks and errors. By default, EKS control
plane logs aren’t sent to CloudWatch Logs. You can enable control plane
logging and select the types of EKS control plane logs you’d like to
capture for each cluster in your account

Collecting application logs requires installing a log aggregator tool
like http://fluentbit.io[Fluent Bit], https://www.fluentd.org[Fluentd],
or
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html[CloudWatch
Container Insights] in your cluster.

Kubernetes log aggregator tools run as DaemonSets and scrape container
logs from nodes. Application logs are then sent to a centralized
destination for storage. For example, CloudWatch Container Insights can
use either Fluent Bit or Fluentd to collect logs and ship them to
CloudWatch Logs for storage. Fluent Bit and Fluentd support many popular
log analytics systems such as Elasticsearch and InfluxDB giving you the
ability to change the storage backend for your logs by modifying Fluent
bit or Fluentd’s log configuration.

=== Use a distributed tracing system to identify bottlenecks

A typical modern application has components distributed over the
network, and its reliability depends on the proper functioning of each
of the components that make up the application. You can use a
distributed tracing solution to understand how requests flow and how
systems communicate. Traces can show you where bottlenecks exist in your
application network and prevent problems that can cause cascading
failures.

You have two options to implement tracing in your applications: you can
either implement distributed tracing at the code level using shared
libraries or use a service mesh.

Implementing tracing at the code level can be disadvantageous. In this
method, you have to make changes to your code. This is further
complicated if you have polyglot applications. You’re also responsible
for maintaining yet another library, across your services.

Service Meshes like http://linkerd.io[LinkerD], http://istio.io[Istio],
and https://aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/[AWS App Mesh] can be used to
implement distributed tracing in your application with minimal changes
to the application code. You can use service mesh to standardize metrics
generation, logging, and tracing.

Tracing tools like https://aws.amazon.com/xray/[AWS X-Ray],
https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger] support both shared library and
service mesh implementations.

Consider using a tracing tool like https://aws.amazon.com/xray/[AWS
X-Ray] or https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger] that supports both
(shared library and service mesh) implementations so you will not have
to switch tools if you later adopt service mesh.

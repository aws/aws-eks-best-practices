Learn best practices for operating EKS clusters.

Welcome to the EKS Best Practices Guides. The primary goal of this
project is to offer a set of best practices for day 2 operations for
Amazon EKS. We elected to publish this guidance to GitHub so we could
iterate quickly, provide timely and effective recommendations for
variety of concerns, and easily incorporate suggestions from the broader
community.

We currently have published guides for the following topics:

* xref:networking[Networking]
* xref:cluster-upgrades[Cluster Upgrades]
* xref:cluster-autoscaling[Cluster Autoscaling]
* xref:reliability[Reliability]

We also open sourced a Python based CLI (Command Line Interface) called
https://github.com/aws-samples/hardeneks[hardeneks] to check some of the
recommendations from this guide.

In the future we will be publishing best practices guidance for
performance, cost optimization, and operational excellence.

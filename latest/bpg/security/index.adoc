This guide provides advice about protecting information, systems, and
assets that are reliant on EKS while delivering business value through
risk assessments and mitigation strategies. The guidance herein is part
of a series of best practices guides that AWS is publishing to help
customers implement EKS in accordance with best practices. Guides for
Performance, Operational Excellence, Cost Optimization, and Reliability
will be available in the coming months.

== How to use this guide

This guide is meant for security practitioners who are responsible for
implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of security controls for
EKS clusters and the workloads they support. The guide is organized into
different topic areas for easier consumption. Each topic starts with a
brief overview, followed by a list of recommendations and best practices
for securing your EKS clusters. The topics do not need to be read in a
particular order.

== Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model

Security and compliance are considered shared responsibilities when
using a managed service like EKS. Generally speaking, AWS is responsible
for security "`of`" the cloud whereas you, the customer, are responsible
for security "`in`" the cloud. With EKS, AWS is responsible for managing
of the EKS managed Kubernetes control plane. This includes the
Kubernetes control plane nodes, the ETCD database, and other
infrastructure necessary for AWS to deliver a secure and reliable
service. As a consumer of EKS, you are largely responsible for the
topics in this guide, e.g. IAM, pod security, runtime security, network
security, and so forth.

When it comes to infrastructure security, AWS will assume additional
responsibilities as you move from self-managed workers, to managed node
groups, to Fargate. For example, with Fargate, AWS becomes responsible
for securing the underlying instance/runtime used to run your Pods.

AWS will also assume responsibility of keeping the EKS optimized AMI up
to date with Kubernetes patch versions and security patches. Customers
using Managed Node Groups (MNG) are responsible for upgrading their
Nodegroups to the latest AMI via EKS API, CLI, Cloudformation or AWS
Console. Also unlike Fargate, MNGs will not automatically scale your
infrastructure/cluster. That can be handled by the
https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws/README.md[cluster-autoscaler]
or other technologies such as https://karpenter.sh/[Karpenter], native
AWS autoscaling, SpotInst’s
https://spot.io/product/ocean[Ocean], or Atlassian’s
https://github.com/atlassian/escalator[Escalator].

Before designing your system, it is important to know where the line of
demarcation is between your responsibilities and the provider of the
service (AWS).

== Introduction

There are several security best practice areas that are pertinent when
using a managed Kubernetes service like EKS:

* Identity and Access Management
* Pod Security
* Runtime Security
* Network Security
* Multi-tenancy
* Multi Account for Multi-tenancy
* Detective Controls
* Infrastructure Security
* Data Encryption and Secrets Management
* Regulatory Compliance
* Incident Response and Forensics
* Image Security

As part of designing any system, you need to think about its security
implications and the practices that can affect your security posture.
For example, you need to control who can perform actions against a set
of resources. You also need the ability to quickly identify security
incidents, protect your systems and services from unauthorized access,
and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data
protection. Having a well-defined and rehearsed set of processes for
responding to security incidents will improve your security posture too.
These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives
such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory
obligations.

AWS helps organizations achieve their security and compliance goals by
offering a rich set of security services that have evolved based on
feedback from a broad set of security conscious customers. By offering a
highly secure foundation, customers can spend less time on
"`undifferentiated heavy lifting`" and more time on achieving their
business objectives.

== Feedback

This guide is being released on GitHub so as to collect direct feedback
and suggestions from the broader EKS/Kubernetes community. If you have a
best practice that you feel we ought to include in the guide, please
file an issue or submit a PR in the GitHub repository. Our intention is
to update the guide periodically as new features are added to the
service or when a new best practice evolves.

this Whitepaper describes key aspects of the Kubernetes attack surface
and security architecture with the aim of helping security practitioners
make sound design and implementation decisions.

paper] on cloud native security. The paper examines how the technology
landscape has evolved and advocates for the adoption of security
practices that align with DevOps processes and agile methodologies.

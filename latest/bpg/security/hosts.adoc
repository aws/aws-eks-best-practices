Inasmuch as it's important to secure your container images, it's equally
important to safeguard the infrastructure that runs them. This section
explores different ways to mitigate risks from attacks launched directly
against the host. These guidelines should be used in conjunction with
those outlined in the xref:runtime-security[Runtime Security] section.

== Recommendations

=== Use an OS optimized for running containers

Consider using Flatcar Linux, Project Atomic, RancherOS, and
https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/[Bottlerocket], a
special purpose OS from AWS designed for running Linux containers. It
includes a reduced attack surface, a disk image that is verified on
boot, and enforced permission boundaries using SELinux.

Alternately, use the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-amis.html[EKS
optimized AMI] for your Kubernetes worker nodes. The EKS optimized AMI
is released regularly and contains a minimal set of OS packages and
binaries necessary to run your containerized workloads.

Please refer https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-ami-rhel[Amazon
EKS AMI RHEL Build Specification] for a sample configuration script
which can be used for building a custom Amazon EKS AMI running on Red
Hat Enterprise Linux using Hashicorp Packer. This script can be further
leveraged to build STIG compliant EKS custom AMIs.

=== Keep your worker node OS updated

Regardless of whether you use a container-optimized host OS like
Bottlerocket or a larger, but still minimalist, Amazon Machine Image
like the EKS optimized AMIs, it is best practice to keep these host OS
images up to date with the latest security patches.

For the EKS optimized AMIs, regularly check the
https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG]
and/or https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/releases[release notes
channel] and automate the rollout of updated worker node images into
your cluster.

=== Treat your infrastructure as immutable and automate the replacement of your worker nodes

Rather than performing in-place upgrades, replace your workers when a
new patch or update becomes available. This can be approached a couple
of ways. You can either add instances to an existing autoscaling group
using the latest AMI as you sequentially cordon and drain nodes until
all of the nodes in the group have been replaced with the latest AMI.
Alternatively, you can add instances to a new node group while you
sequentially cordon and drain nodes from the old node group until all of
the nodes have been replaced. EKS
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html[managed
node groups] uses the first approach and will display a message in the
console to upgrade your workers when a new AMI becomes available.
`eksctl` also has a mechanism for creating node groups with the latest
AMI and for gracefully cordoning and draining pods from nodes groups
before the instances are terminated. If you decide to use a different
method for replacing your worker nodes, it is strongly recommended that
you automate the process to minimize human oversight as you will likely
need to replace workers regularly as new updates/patches are released
and when the control plane is upgraded.

With EKS Fargate, AWS will automatically update the underlying
infrastructure as updates become available. Oftentimes this can be done
seamlessly, but there may be times when an update will cause your pod to
be rescheduled. Hence, we recommend that you create deployments with
multiple replicas when running your application as a Fargate pod.

=== Periodically run kube-bench to verify compliance with https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/[CIS benchmarks for Kubernetes]

kube-bench is an open source project from Aqua that evaluates your
cluster against the CIS benchmarks for Kubernetes. The benchmark
describes the best practices for securing unmanaged Kubernetes clusters.
The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark encompasses the control plane and the data
plane. Since Amazon EKS provides a fully managed control plane, not all
of the recommendations from the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark are applicable.
To ensure this scope reflects how Amazon EKS is implemented, AWS created
the _CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark_. The EKS benchmark inherits from CIS
Kubernetes Benchmark with additional inputs from the community with
specific configuration considerations for EKS clusters.

When running https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench[kube-bench]
against an EKS cluster, follow
https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/blob/main/docs/running.md#running-cis-benchmark-in-an-eks-cluster[these
instructions] from Aqua Security. For further information see
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-cis-amazon-eks-benchmark/[Introducing
The CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark].

=== Minimize access to worker nodes

Instead of enabling SSH access, use
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html[SSM
Session Manager] when you need to remote into a host. Unlike SSH keys
which can be lost, copied, or shared, Session Manager allows you to
control access to EC2 instances using IAM. Moreover, it provides an
audit trail and log of the commands that were run on the instance.

As of August 19th, 2020 Managed Node Groups support custom AMIs and EC2
Launch Templates. This allows you to embed the SSM agent into the AMI or
install it as the worker node is being bootstrapped. If you rather not
modify the Optimized AMI or the ASG’s launch template, you can install
the SSM agent with a DaemonSet as in
https://github.com/aws-samples/ssm-agent-daemonset-installer[this
example].

==== Minimal IAM policy for SSM based SSH Access

The `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` AWS managed policy contains a
number of permissions that are not required for SSM Session Manager /
SSM RunCommand if you’re just looking to avoid SSH access. Of concern
specifically is the `*` permissions for `ssm:GetParameter(s)` which
would allow for the role to access all parameters in Parameter Store
(including SecureStrings with the AWS managed KMS key configured).

The following IAM policy contains the minimal set of permissions to
enable node access via SSM Systems Manager.

[source,json]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EnableAccessViaSSMSessionManager",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel",
        "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
        "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
        "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel",
        "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "EnableSSMRunCommand",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation",
        "ec2messages:SendReply",
        "ec2messages:GetMessages",
        "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
        "ec2messages:FailMessage",
        "ec2messages:DeleteMessage",
        "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
----

With this policy in place and the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html[Session
Manager plugin] installed, you can then run

[source,bash]
----
aws ssm start-session --target [INSTANCE_ID_OF_EKS_NODE]
----

to access the node.

[NOTE]
====
You may also want to consider adding permissions to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile.html#create-iam-instance-profile-ssn-logging[enable Session Manager logging].
====

=== Deploy workers onto private subnets

By deploying workers onto private subnets, you minimize their exposure
to the Internet where attacks often originate. Beginning April 22, 2020,
the assignment of public IP addresses to nodes in a managed node groups
will be controlled by the subnet they are deployed onto. Prior to this,
nodes in a Managed Node Group were automatically assigned a public IP.
If you choose to deploy your worker nodes on to public subnets,
implement restrictive AWS security group rules to limit their exposure.

=== Run Amazon Inspector to assess hosts for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices

You can use
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/what-is-inspector.html[Amazon
Inspector] to check for unintended network access to your nodes and for
vulnerabilities on the underlying Amazon EC2 instances.

Amazon Inspector can provide common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE)
data for your Amazon EC2 instances only if the Amazon EC2 Systems
Manager (SSM) agent is installed and enabled. This agent is preinstalled
on several
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ami-preinstalled-agent.html[Amazon
Machine Images (AMIs)] including
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html[EKS
optimized Amazon Linux AMIs]. Regardless of SSM agent status, all of
your Amazon EC2 instances are scanned for network reachability issues.
For more information about configuring scans for Amazon EC2, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/enable-disable-scanning-ec2.html[Scanning
Amazon EC2 instances].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Inspector cannot be run on the infrastructure used to run Fargate pods.

== Alternatives

[[iam-se-linux,iam-se-linux.title]]
=== Run SELinux

[NOTE]
====
Available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Bottlerocket, and Amazon Linux 2023
====

SELinux provides an additional layer of security to keep containers
isolated from each other and from the host. SELinux allows
administrators to enforce mandatory access controls (MAC) for every
user, application, process, and file. Think of it as a backstop that
restricts the operations that can be performed against to specific
resources based on a set of labels. On EKS, SELinux can be used to
prevent containers from accessing each other's resources.

Container SELinux policies are defined in the
https://github.com/containers/container-selinux[container-selinux]
package. Docker CE requires this package (along with its dependencies)
so that the processes and files created by Docker (or other container
runtimes) run with limited system access. Containers leverage the
`container_t` label which is an alias to `svirt_lxc_net_t`. These
policies effectively prevent containers from accessing certain features
of the host.

When you configure SELinux for Docker, Docker automatically labels
workloads `container_t` as a type and gives each container a unique
MCS level. This will isolate containers from one another. If you need
looser restrictions, you can create your own profile in SElinux which
grants a container permissions to specific areas of the file system.
This is similar to PSPs in that you can create different profiles for
different containers/pods. For example, you can have a profile for
general workloads with a set of restrictive controls and another for
things that require privileged access.

SELinux for Containers has a set of options that can be configured to
modify the default restrictions. The following SELinux Booleans can be
enabled or disabled based on your needs:

[width="100%",cols="30%,^40%,30%",options="header",]
|===
|Boolean |Default |Description
|`container_connect_any` |`off` |Allow containers to access
privileged ports on the host. For example, if you have a container that
needs to map ports to 443 or 80 on the host.

|`container_manage_cgroup` |`off` |Allow containers to manage cgroup
configuration. For example, a container running systemd will need this
to be enabled.

|`container_use_cephfs` |`off` |Allow containers to use a ceph file
system.
|===

By default, containers are allowed to read/execute under `/usr` and
read most content from `/etc`. The files under `/var/lib/docker` and
`/var/lib/containers` have the label `container_var_lib_t`. To view
a full list of default, labels see the
https://github.com/containers/container-selinux/blob/master/container.fc[container.fc]
file.

[source,bash]
----
docker container run -it \
  -v /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/repositories.json:/host/repositories.json \
  centos:7 cat /host/repositories.json
# cat: /host/repositories.json: Permission denied

docker container run -it \
  -v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd \
  centos:7 cat /host/etc/passwd
# cat: /host/etc/passwd: Permission denied
----

Files labeled with `container_file_t` are the only files that are
writable by containers. If you want a volume mount to be writeable, you
will needed to specify `:z` or `:Z` at the end.

* `:z` will re-label the files so that the container can read/write
* `:Z` will re-label the files so that *only* the container can
read/write

[source,bash]
----
ls -Z /var/lib/misc
# -rw-r--r--. root root system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0   postfix.aliasesdb-stamp

docker container run -it \
  -v /var/lib/misc:/host/var/lib/misc:z \
  centos:7 echo "Relabeled!"

ls -Z /var/lib/misc
#-rw-r--r--. root root system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0 postfix.aliasesdb-stamp
----

[source,bash]
----
docker container run -it \
  -v /var/log:/host/var/log:Z \
  fluentbit:latest
----

In Kubernetes, relabeling is slightly different. Rather than having
Docker automatically relabel the files, you can specify a custom MCS
label to run the pod. Volumes that support relabeling will automatically
be relabeled so that they are accessible. Pods with a matching MCS label
will be able to access the volume. If you need strict isolation, set a
different MCS label for each pod.

[source,yaml]
----
securityContext:
  seLinuxOptions:
    # Provide a unique MCS label per container
    # You can specify user, role, and type also
    # enforcement based on type and level (svert)
    level: s0:c144:c154
----

In this example `s0:c144:c154` corresponds to an MCS label assigned to
a file that the container is allowed to access.

On EKS you could create policies that allow for privileged containers to
run, like FluentD and create an SELinux policy to allow it to read from
/var/log on the host without needing to relabel the host directory. Pods
with the same label will be able to access the same host volumes.

We have implemented
https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-custom-amis[sample AMIs for
Amazon EKS] that have SELinux configured on CentOS 7 and RHEL 7. These
AMIs were developed to demonstrate sample implementations that meet
requirements of highly regulated customers.

[WARNING]
====
SELinux will ignore containers where the type is unconfined.

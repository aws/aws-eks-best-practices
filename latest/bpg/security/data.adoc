== Encryption at rest

There are three different AWS-native storage options you can use with
Kubernetes:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html[EBS],
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEFS.html[EFS],
and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/what-is.html[FSx
for Lustre]. All three offer encryption at rest using a service managed
key or a customer master key (CMK). For EBS you can use the in-tree
storage driver or the
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver[EBS CSI driver].
Both include parameters for encrypting volumes and supplying a CMK. For
EFS, you can use the
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver[EFS CSI driver],
however, unlike EBS, the EFS CSI driver does not support dynamic
provisioning. If you want to use EFS with EKS, you will need to
provision and configure at-rest encryption for the file system prior to
creating a PV. For further information about EFS file encryption, please
refer to
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/encryption-at-rest.html[Encrypting
Data at Rest]. Besides offering at-rest encryption, EFS and FSx for
Lustre include an option for encrypting data in transit. FSx for Lustre
does this by default. For EFS, you can add transport encryption by
adding the `tls` parameter to `mountOptions` in your PV as in this
example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: efs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: efs-sc
  mountOptions:
    - tls
  csi:
    driver: efs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: <file_system_id>
----

The https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-fsx-csi-driver[FSx CSI
driver] supports dynamic provisioning of Lustre file systems. It
encrypts data with a service managed key by default, although there is
an option to provide your own CMK as in this example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: fsx-sc
provisioner: fsx.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  subnetId: subnet-056da83524edbe641
  securityGroupIds: sg-086f61ea73388fb6b
  deploymentType: PERSISTENT_1
  kmsKeyId: <kms_arn>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of May 28, 2020 all data written to the ephemeral volume in EKS Fargate pods is encrypted by default using an industry-standard AES-256 cryptographic algorithm. No modifications to your application are necessary as encryption and decryption are handled seamlessly by the service.
====

=== Encrypt data at rest

Encrypting data at rest is considered a best practice. If you’re unsure
whether encryption is necessary, encrypt your data.

=== Rotate your CMKs periodically

Configure KMS to automatically rotate your CMKs. This will rotate your
keys once a year while saving old keys indefinitely so that your data
can still be decrypted. For additional information see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html[Rotating
customer master keys]

=== Use EFS access points to simplify access to shared datasets

If you have shared datasets with different POSIX file permissions or
want to restrict access to part of the shared file system by creating
different mount points, consider using EFS access points. To learn more
about working with access points, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html. Today,
if you want to use an access point (AP) you’ll need to reference the AP
in the PV’s `volumeHandle` parameter.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of March 23, 2021 the EFS CSI driver supports dynamic
provisioning of EFS Access Points. Access points are
application-specific entry points into an EFS file system that make it
easier to share a file system between multiple pods. Each EFS file
system can have up to 120 PVs. See
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-efs-csi-dynamic-provisioning/[Introducing
Amazon EFS CSI dynamic provisioning] for additional information.
====

== Secrets management

Kubernetes secrets are used to store sensitive information, such as user
certificates, passwords, or API keys. They are persisted in etcd as
base64 encoded strings. On EKS, the EBS volumes for etcd nodes are
encrypted with
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html[EBS
encryption]. A pod can retrieve a Kubernetes secrets objects by
referencing the secret in the `podSpec`. These secrets can either be
mapped to an environment variable or mounted as volume. For additional
information on creating secrets, see
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/.

[WARNING]
====
Secrets in a particular namespace can be referenced by all pods in the secret’s namespace.
====

[WARNING]
====
The node authorizer allows the Kubelet to read all of the secrets mounted to the node.
====

=== Use AWS KMS for envelope encryption of Kubernetes secrets

This allows you to encrypt your secrets with a unique data encryption
key (DEK). The DEK is then encrypted using a key encryption key (KEK)
from AWS KMS which can be automatically rotated on a recurring schedule.
With the KMS plugin for Kubernetes, all Kubernetes secrets are stored in
etcd in ciphertext instead of plain text and can only be decrypted by
the Kubernetes API server. For additional details, see
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-eks-encryption-provider-support-for-defense-in-depth/[using
EKS encryption provider support for defense in depth]

=== Audit the use of Kubernetes Secrets

On EKS, turn on audit logging and create a CloudWatch metrics filter and
alarm to alert you when a secret is used (optional). The following is an
example of a metrics filter for the Kubernetes audit log,
`{($.verb="get") && ($.objectRef.resource="secret")}`. You can also
use the following queries with CloudWatch Log Insights:

[source,bash]
----
fields @timestamp, @message
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
| stats count(*) by objectRef.name as secret
| filter verb="get" and objectRef.resource="secrets"
----

The above query will display the number of times a secret has been
accessed within a specific timeframe.

[source,bash]
----
fields @timestamp, @message
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
| filter verb="get" and objectRef.resource="secrets"
| display objectRef.namespace, objectRef.name, user.username, responseStatus.code
----

This query will display the secret, along with the namespace and
username of the user who attempted to access the secret and the response
code.

=== Rotate your secrets periodically

Kubernetes doesn’t automatically rotate secrets. If you have to rotate
secrets, consider using an external secret store, e.g. Vault or AWS
Secrets Manager.

=== Use separate namespaces as a way to isolate secrets from different applications

If you have secrets that cannot be shared between applications in a
namespace, create a separate namespace for those applications.

=== Use volume mounts instead of environment variables

The values of environment variables can unintentionally appear in logs.
Secrets mounted as volumes are instantiated as tmpfs volumes (a RAM
backed file system) that are automatically removed from the node when
the pod is deleted.

=== Use an external secrets provider

There are several viable alternatives to using Kubernetes secrets,
including https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager]
and Hashicorp’s
https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/injecting-vault-secrets-into-kubernetes-pods-via-a-sidecar/[Vault].
These services offer features such as fine grained access controls,
strong encryption, and automatic rotation of secrets that are not
available with Kubernetes Secrets. Bitnami’s
https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets[Sealed Secrets] is
another approach that uses asymmetric encryption to create "`sealed
secrets`". A public key is used to encrypt the secret while the private
key used to decrypt the secret is kept within the cluster, allowing you
to safely store sealed secrets in source control systems like Git. See
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/managing-secrets-deployment-in-kubernetes-using-sealed-secrets/[Managing
secrets deployment in Kubernetes using Sealed Secrets] for further
information.

As the use of external secrets stores has grown, so has need for
integrating them with Kubernetes. The
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver[Secret Store
CSI Driver] is a community project that uses the CSI driver model to
fetch secrets from external secret stores. Currently, the Driver has
support for
https://github.com/aws/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-aws[AWS Secrets
Manager], Azure, Vault, and GCP. The AWS provider supports both AWS
Secrets Manager *and* AWS Parameter Store. It can also be configured to
rotate secrets when they expire and can synchronize AWS Secrets Manager
secrets to Kubernetes Secrets. Synchronization of secrets can be useful
when you need to reference a secret as an environment variable instead
of reading them from a volume.

[NOTE]
====
When the secret store CSI driver has to fetch a secret, it assumes the IRSA role assigned to the pod that references a secret. The code for this operation can be found https://github.com/aws/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-aws/blob/main/auth/auth.go[here].

For additional information about the AWS Secrets & Configuration
Provider (ASCP) refer to the following resources:

to use AWS Secrets Configuration Provider with Kubernetes Secret Store
CSI Driver]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/integrating_csi_driver.html[Integrating
Secrets Manager secrets with Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver]

https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets[external-secrets]
is yet another way to use an external secret store with Kubernetes. Like
the CSI Driver, external-secrets works against a variety of different
backends, including AWS Secrets Manager. The difference is, rather than
retrieving secrets from the external secret store, external-secrets
copies secrets from these backends to Kubernetes as Secrets. This lets
you manage secrets using your preferred secret store and interact with
secrets in a Kubernetes-native way.

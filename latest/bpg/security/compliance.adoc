Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the consumers of
its services. Generally speaking, AWS is responsible for "`security of
the cloud`" whereas its users are responsible for "`security in the
cloud.`" The line that delineates what AWS and its users are responsible
for will vary depending on the service. For example, with Fargate, AWS
is responsible for managing the physical security of its data centers,
the hardware, the virtual infrastructure (Amazon EC2), and the container
runtime (Docker). Users of Fargate are responsible for securing the
container image and their application. Knowing who is responsible for
what is an important consideration when running workloads that must
adhere to compliance standards.

The following table shows the compliance programs with which the
different container services conform.

== Shifting Left

The concept of shifting left involves catching policy violations and
errors earlier in the software development lifecycle. From a security
perspective, this can be very beneficial. A developer, for example, can
fix issues with their configuration before their application is deployed
to the cluster. Catching mistakes like this earlier will help prevent
configurations that violate your policies from being deployed.

=== Policy as Code

Policy can be thought of as a set of rules for governing behaviors,
i.e. behaviors that are allowed or those that are prohibited. For
example, you may have a policy that says that all Dockerfiles should
include a USER directive that causes the container to run as a non-root
user. As a document, a policy like this can be hard to discover and
enforce. It may also become outdated as your requirements change. With
Policy as Code (PaC) solutions, you can automate security, compliance,
and privacy controls that detect, prevent, reduce, and counteract known
and persistent threats. Furthermore, they give you mechanism to codify
your policies and manage them as you do other code artifacts. The
benefit of this approach is that you can reuse your DevOps and GitOps
strategies to manage and consistently apply policies across fleets of
Kubernetes clusters. Please refer to
https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/pods/#pod-security[Pod
Security] for information about PaC options and the future of PSPs.

=== Use policy-as-code tools in pipelines to detect violations before deployment

* https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[OPA] is an open source policy engine
that’s part of the CNCF. It’s used for making policy decisions and can
be run a variety of different ways, e.g. as a language library or a
service. OPA policies are written in a Domain Specific Language (DSL)
called Rego. While it is often run as part of a Kubernetes Dynamic
Admission Controller as the
https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper[Gatekeeper] project, OPA
can also be incorporated into your CI/CD pipeline. This allows
developers to get feedback about their configuration earlier in the
release cycle which can subsequently help them resolve issues before
they get to production. A collection of common OPA policies can be found
in the GitHub
https://github.com/aws/aws-eks-best-practices/tree/master/policies/opa[repository]
for this project.
* https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest[Conftest] is built on
top of OPA and it provides a developer focused experience for testing
Kubernetes configuration.
* https://kyverno.io/[Kyverno] is a policy engine designed for
Kubernetes. With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources
and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using
familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies.
Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources
plus ensure OCI image supply chain security. The
https://kyverno.io/docs/kyverno-cli/[Kyverno CLI] can be used to test
policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline. All the
Kyverno community policies can be found on the
https://kyverno.io/policies/[Kyverno website], and for examples using
the Kyverno CLI to write tests in pipelines, see the
https://github.com/kyverno/policies[policies repository].

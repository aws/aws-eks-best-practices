== Security and Compliance

=== Consider S3 with KMS for encryption-compliant storage

Unless you specify otherwise, all S3 buckets use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html[SSE-S3] by default to encrypt objects at rest.
However, you can choose to configure buckets to use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) instead. The security controls in AWS KMS can help you meet encryption-related compliance requirements. You can use these KMS keys to protect your data in Amazon S3 buckets. When you use SSE-KMS encryption with an S3 bucket, the AWS KMS keys must be in the same Region as the bucket. 

Configure your https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html[general purpose buckets] to use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html#sse-kms-bucket-keys[S3 Bucket Keys for SSE-KMS], to reduce your AWS KMS request costs by up to 99 percent by decreasing the request traffic from Amazon S3 to AWS KMS. S3 Bucket Keys https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-UsingKMSEncryption.html#s3-express-sse-kms-bucket-keys[are always enabled] for `GET` and `PUT` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled.

Note that https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/express-one-zone/[Amazon S3 Express One Zone] uses a specific type of bucket called an _S3 directory bucket_. Directory buckets are exclusively for the S3 Express One Zone storage class and enable high-performance, low-latency access.
To https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html[configure default bucket encryption on an S3 directory bucket], use the AWS CLI, and specify the KMS key ID or ARN, not the alias, as in the following example:
====

[source,bash]
----
aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket my-directory-bucket --server-side-encryption-configuration \
   '{"Rules": [{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {"SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms", "KMSMasterKeyID": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"}}]}'
----

Ensure your EKS pod’s IAM role has KMS permissions (e.g., `kms:Decrypt`) to access encrypted objects.
Test this in a staging environment by uploading a sample model to the bucket, mounting it in a pod (e.g., via the Mountpoint S3 CSI driver), and verifying the pod can read the encrypted data without errors.
Audit logs via AWS CloudTrail to confirm compliance with encryption requirements. See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/[KMS Documentation] for setup details and key management.

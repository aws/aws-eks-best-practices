Implementing best practices when running AI/ML workloads on EKS can ensure that those workloads are performant, cost-effective, resilient, and properly resourced.
Best practices are divided into the following general sections: Compute, Networking, Storage, Observability, and Performance.

== Feedback

This guide is being released on GitHub so as to collect direct feedback and suggestions from the broader EKS/Kubernetes community. If you have a best practice that you feel we ought to include in the guide, please file an issue or submit a PR in the GitHub repository. Our intention is to update the guide periodically as new features are added to the service or when a new best practice evolves.

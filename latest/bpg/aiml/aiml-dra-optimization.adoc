:info_titleabbrev: Optimization techniques

Modern GPU workloads require sophisticated resource management to
achieve optimal utilization and cost efficiency. DRA enables several
advanced optimization techniques that address different use cases and
hardware capabilities:

* *Time-slicing* allows multiple workloads to share GPU compute
resources over time, making it ideal for inference workloads with
sporadic GPU usage. For an example, see <<aiml-dra-timeslicing>>.
* *Multi-Process service (MPS)* enables concurrent execution of multiple
CUDA processes on a single GPU with better isolation than time-slicing.
For an example, see <<aiml-dra-mps>>.
* *Multi-Instance GPU (MIG)* provides hardware-level partitioning,
creating isolated GPU instances with dedicated compute and memory
resources. For an example, see <<aiml-dra-mig>>.
* *Internode Memory Exchange (IMEX)* enables memory-coherent
communication across nodes for distributed training on NVIDIA GB200
systems. For an example, see <<aiml-dra-imex>>.

These techniques can significantly improve resource utilization.
Organizations report GPU utilization increases from 30-40% with
traditional allocation to 80-90% with optimized sharing strategies. The
choice of technique depends on workload characteristics, isolation
requirements, and hardware capabilities.

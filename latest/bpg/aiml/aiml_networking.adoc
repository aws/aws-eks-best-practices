=== Consider Higher Network Bandwidth or Elastic Fabric Adapter For Applications with High Inter-Node Communication

For distributed training workloads on Amazon EKS with high inter-node communication demands, consider selecting instances with higher network bandwidth or https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/node-efa.html[Elastic Fabric Adapter] (EFA). Insufficient network performance can bottleneck data transfer, slowing down machine learning tasks like distributed multi-GPU training. Note that inference workloads don’t typically have high inter-node communication.

**Example**

For example, using Karpenter:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ml-workload
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-network-bandwidth: "100000"  # 100 Gbps in Mbps
    node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: p5.48xlarge  # EFA-enabled instance
  containers:
  - name: training-job
    image: `763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pytorch-inference:2.6.0-gpu-py312-cu124-ubuntu22.04-ec2-v1.6`
    resources:
      limits:
        vpc.amazonaws.com/efa: 1  # Requires EFA device plugin
----

Ensure tools like MPI and NCCL are installed in your container image to leverage EFA for training jobs.

Anyone can contribute to the best practices guide. The EKS Best Practices Guide is written in the AsciiDoc format on GitHub. 

== Summary for existing contributors

* Open the https://github.com/aws/aws-eks-best-practices/blob/master/bpg-docs.code-workspace[`bpg-docs.code-workspace`] with VS Code to automatically install the AsciiDoc extension.
** Learn more about the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc Extension] on the Visual Studio Marketplace. 
* The source files for the AWS Docs website are stored in https://github.com/aws/aws-eks-best-practices/tree/master/latest/bpg[`latest/bpg`]
* The syntax is highly similar to markdown. 
** Review the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[Syntax Reference] in the AsciiDoctor docs. 
* The docs platform only deploys `latest/bpg/images`. Each of the guide sections has a symbolic link back to this directory. For example, `latest/bpg/networking/images` points to `latest/bpg/images`. 

== Setup a local editing environment

If you plan to edit the guide frequently, setup a local editing environment. 

=== Fork and clone the repo

You need to be familiar with `git`, `github`, and text editors. For information on getting started with `git` and `github`, see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account[Getting started with your GitHub account] in the GitHub docs. 

. View the https://github.com/aws/aws-eks-best-practices[EKS Best Practices Guide on GitHub]. 
. Create a fork of the project repo. Learn how to https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository[fork a repository] in the GitHub docs. 
. Clone your fork of the project repo. Learn how to https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository[clone your forked repository]. 

=== Open the VS Code Workspace

AWS recommends using Visual Studio Code from Microsoft to edit the guide. For more information about VS Code, see https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Download Visual Studio Code] and https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started[Get started with Visual Studio Code] in the Visual Studio Code Documentation. 

. Open VS Code.
. Open the `bpg-docs.code-workspace` file from the cloned repo.
. If this is your first time opening this workspace, accept the prompt to install the AsciiDoc extension. This extension checks the syntax of AsciiDoc files and generates a live preview. 
. Browse to the `latest/bpg` directory. This directory holds the source files that deploy to the AWS documentation site. The source files are organized by guide section, such as "security" or "networking".

=== Edit a file

. Open a file in the editor. 
** View the AsciiDoc Syntax to learn how to create headings, links, and lists. 
** You can use Markdown syntax to format text, create lists, and headings. You cannot use Markdown syntax to create links. 
. Open a live preview of the page.
** First, press `ctrl-k` or `cmd-k` (depending on keyboard). Second, press `v`. This opens a preview in split view. 

AWS suggests using feature branches to organize your changes. Learn how to create branches with git. 

=== Submit a Pull Request

You can create a pull request from the GitHub website or the GitHub cli. 

Learn how to https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork[create a pull request from a fork] by using the GitHub Website.

Learn how to https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_create[create a pull request] by using the GitHub cli. 

== Use the github.dev web-based editor

The `github.dev` web-based editor is based on VS Code. This is a great way to edit multiple files and preview content without any setup. 

It has support for the AsciiDoc extension. You can do git operations by using the GUI. The web-based editor does not have a shell or terminal for running commands. 

You must have a GitHub account. You will be prompted to login if required. 

https://github.dev/aws/aws-eks-best-practices/blob/master/bpg-docs.code-workspace?workspace=true[üöÄ Launch the GitHub web-based editor.] 

== Edit a single page 

You can rapidly update individual pages by using GitHub. Each page contains an "üìù Edit this page on GitHub" link at the bottom. 

. Navigate to the page in this guide you want to edit
. Click the "Edit this page on GitHub" link at the bottom
. Click the edit pencil icon on the top right of the GitHub file viewer, or press `e`
. Edit the file
. Submit your changes using the "Commit changes..." button. This button creates a GitHub pull request. The guide maintainers will review this pull request. A reviewer will approve the pull request, or request changes. 

== View and set the ID for a page

This page explains how to view and set page ID. 

The page ID is a unique string that identifies each page on the documentation site. You can view the page ID in the address bar of your browser when you're on a specific page. The page ID is used for the URL, the filename, and to create cross-reference links. 

For example, if you're viewing this page, the URL in your browser's address bar will look similar to:

```
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/view-set-page-id.html
```

The last part of the URL (`view-set-page-id`) is the page ID.

=== Set the page ID

When creating a new page, you need to set the page ID in the source file. The page ID should be a concise, hyphenated string that describes the page content.

. Open the source file for your new page in a text editor.
. At the top of the file, add the following line. It should be above the first heading.
+
```asciidoc
[#my-new-page]
```
+
Replace `my-new-page` with the page ID for your new page.
. Save the file.

NOTE: Page IDs must be unique across the entire documentation site. If you try to use an existing page ID, you'll get a build error.


== Create a new page

Learn how create a new page and update the guide table of contents. 

=== Create page metadata

. Determine the page title, and page short title. The page short title is optional, but recommended if the page title is more than a few words. 
. Determine the ID of the page. This must be unique within the EKS Best Practices Guide. The convention is to use all lowercase, and separate words with `-`.
. Create a new asciidoc file, in a folder if needed, and add the following text to the file:
+
====
+[."topic"]+
+[#<page-id>]+
+= <page-title>+
+:info_titleabbrev: <page-short-title>+
====
+
For example,
+
====
+[."topic"]+
+[#scalability]+
+= EKS Scalability best practices+
+:info_titleabbrev: Scalability+
====


=== Add to table of contents

. Open the file for the parent page in the table of contents. For new top level guide sections, the parent file is `book.adoc`.
. At the bottom of the parent file, update and insert the following directive:
+ 
====
+include::<new-filename>[leveloffset=+1]+
====
+
For Example,
+
====
+include::dataplane.adoc[leveloffset=+1]+
====

== Insert an image

. Find the image prefix for the page you are editing. Review the `:imagesdir:` property in the heading of the file. For examples, ``:imagesdir: images/reliability/`
. Place your image in this path, such as `latest/bpg/images/reliability`
. Determine appropriate alt-text for you image. Write a short high-level description of the image. For example, "diagram of VPC with three availability zones" is appropriate alt-text. 
. Update the following example with the alt-text and image filename. Insert at the desired location. 
+
====
+image::<image-filename>[<image-alt-text>]+
====
+
For example,
+
====
+image::eks-data-plane-connectivity.jpeg[Network diagram]+
====

== Check style with Vale

. https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/[Install the Vale CLI.]
. Run `vale sync`
. Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChrisChinchilla.vale-vscode[Vale Extension] from the Visual Studio Marketplace. 
. Restart VS Code, and open an AsciiDoc file
. VS Code underlines problematic text. Learn how to work with https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_errors-warnings[Errors and Warnings] in the VS Code docs. 

== Build a local preview

. Install the `asciidoctor` tool using `brew` on Linux or MacOS
** Learn how to https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/[install asciidoctor cli] in the AsciiDoctor docs. 
** Learn how https://brew.sh/index.html[install the brew package manager].  
. Open a terminal, and navigate to `latest/bpg/`
. Run `asciidoctor book.adoc`
** Review any syntax warnings and errors
. Open the `book.html` output file.
** On MacOS, you can run `open book.html` to open the preview in your default browser.

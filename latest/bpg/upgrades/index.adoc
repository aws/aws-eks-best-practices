Learn best practices for cluster upgrades.
--

This guide shows cluster administrators how to plan and execute their
Amazon EKS upgrade strategy. It also describes how to upgrade
self-managed nodes, managed node groups, Karpenter nodes, and Fargate
nodes. It does not include guidance on EKS Anywhere, self-managed
Kubernetes, AWS Outposts, or AWS Local Zones.

== Overview

A Kubernetes version encompasses both the control plane and the data
plane. To ensure smooth operation, both the control plane and the data
plane should run the same
https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions[Kubernetes
minor version&#44; such as 1.24]. While AWS manages and upgrades the
control plane, updating the worker nodes in the data plane is your
responsibility.

* *Control plane* — The version of the control plane is determined by
the Kubernetes API server. In Amazon EKS clusters, AWS takes care of
managing this component. Control plane upgrades can be initiated via the
AWS API.
* *Data plane* — The data plane version is associated with the Kubelet
versions running on your individual nodes. It’s possible to have nodes
in the same cluster running different versions. You can check the
versions of all nodes by running `kubectl get nodes`.

== Before Upgrading

If you’re planning to upgrade your Kubernetes version in Amazon EKS,
there are a few important policies, tools, and procedures you should put
in place before starting an upgrade.

* *Understand Deprecation Policies* — Gain a deep understanding of how
the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/[Kubernetes
deprecation policy] works. Be aware of any upcoming changes that may
affect your existing applications. Newer versions of Kubernetes often
phase out certain APIs and features, potentially causing issues for
running applications.
* *Review Kubernetes Change Log* — Thoroughly review the
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/CHANGELOG[Kubernetes
change log] alongside
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html[Amazon
EKS Kubernetes versions] to understand any possible impact to your
cluster, such as breaking changes that may affect your workloads.
* *Assess Cluster Add-Ons Compatibility* — Amazon EKS doesn’t
automatically update an add-on when new versions are released or after
you update your cluster to a new Kubernetes minor version. Review
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-add-ons.html#updating-an-add-on[Updating
an add-on] to understand the compatibility of any existing cluster
add-ons with the cluster version you intend to upgrade to.
* *Enable Control Plane Logging* — Enable
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html[control
plane logging] to capture logs, errors, or issues that can arise during
the upgrade process. Consider reviewing these logs for any anomalies.
Test cluster upgrades in a non-production environment, or integrate
automated tests into your continuous integration workflow to assess
version compatibility with your applications, controllers, and custom
integrations.
* *Explore eksctl for Cluster Management* — Consider using
https://eksctl.io/[eksctl] to manage your EKS cluster. It provides you
with the ability to https://eksctl.io/usage/cluster-upgrade/[update the
control plane&#44; manage add-ons&#44; and handle worker node updates]
out-of-the-box.
* *Opt for Managed Node Groups or EKS on Fargate* — Streamline and
automate worker node upgrades by using
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html[EKS
managed node groups] or
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html[EKS on
Fargate]. These options simplify the process and reduce manual
intervention.
* *Utilize kubectl Convert Plugin* — Leverage the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/#install-kubectl-convert-plugin[kubectl
convert plugin] to facilitate the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/included/kubectl-convert-overview/[conversion
of Kubernetes manifest files] between different API versions. This can
help ensure that your configurations remain compatible with the new
Kubernetes version.

== Keep your cluster up-to-date

Staying current with Kubernetes updates is paramount for a secure and
efficient EKS environment, reflecting the shared responsibility model in
Amazon EKS. By integrating these strategies into your operational
workflow, you’re positioning yourself to maintain up-to-date, secure
clusters that take full advantage of the latest features and
improvements. Tactics:

* *Supported Version Policy* — Aligned with the Kubernetes community,
Amazon EKS typically provides three active Kubernetes versions while
deprecating a fourth version each year. Deprecation notices are issued
at least 60 days before a version reaches its end-of-support date. For
more details, refer to the
https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-version-faq/[EKS Version FAQ].
* *Auto-Upgrade Policy* — We strongly recommend staying in sync with
Kubernetes updates in your EKS cluster. Kubernetes community support,
including bug fixes and security patches, typically ceases for versions
older than one year. Deprecated versions may also lack vulnerability
reporting, posing a potential risk. Failure to proactively upgrade
before a version’s end-of-life triggers an automatic upgrade, which
could disrupt your workloads and systems. For additional information,
consult the https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-version-support-policy/[EKS
Version Support Policy].
* *Create Upgrade Runbooks* — Establish a well-documented process for
managing upgrades. As part of your proactive approach, develop runbooks
and specialized tools tailored to your upgrade process. This not only
enhances your preparedness but also simplifies complex transitions. Make
it a standard practice to upgrade your clusters at least once a year.
This practice aligns you with ongoing technological advancements,
thereby boosting the efficiency and security of your environment.

== Review the EKS release calendar

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#kubernetes-release-calendar[Review
the EKS Kubernetes release calendar] to learn when new versions are
coming, and when support for specific versions end. Generally, EKS
releases three minor versions of Kubernetes annually, and each minor
version is supported for about 14 months.

Additionally, review the upstream
https://kubernetes.io/releases/[Kubernetes release information].

== Understand how the shared responsibility model applies to cluster upgrades

You are responsible for initiating upgrade for both cluster control
plane as well as the data plane.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html[Learn
how to initiate an upgrade.] When you initiate a cluster upgrade, AWS
manages upgrading the cluster control plane. You are responsible for
upgrading the data plane, including Fargate pods and
<<upgrade-addons, addons>>. You must validate and plan upgrades for workloads running on
your cluster to ensure their availability and operations are not
impacted after cluster upgrade

== Upgrade clusters in-place

EKS supports an in-place cluster upgrade strategy. This maintains
cluster resources, and keeps cluster configuration consistent (e.g., API
endpoint, OIDC, ENIs, load balancers). This is less disruptive for
cluster users, and it will use the existing workloads and resources in
the cluster without requiring you to redeploy workloads or migrate
external resources (e.g., DNS, storage).

When performing an in-place cluster upgrade, it is important to note
that only one minor version upgrade can be executed at a time (e.g.,
from 1.24 to 1.25).

This means that if you need to update multiple versions, a series of
sequential upgrades will be required. Planning sequential upgrades is
more complicated, and has a higher risk of downtime. In this situation, see <<bluegreen>>.

== Upgrade your control plane and data plane in sequence

To upgrade a cluster you will need to take the following actions:

[arabic]
. xref:usedocs[Review
the Kubernetes and EKS release notes.]
. xref:backup-the-cluster-before-upgrading[Take a backup of the
cluster. (optional)]
. xref:identify-and-remediate-removed-api-usage-before-upgrading-the-control-plane[Identify

version as your upgraded cluster.

[[usedocs, usedocs.title]]
== Use the EKS Documentation to create an upgrade checklist

The EKS Kubernetes
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html[version
documentation] includes a detailed list of changes for each version.
Build a checklist for each upgrade.

For specific EKS version upgrade guidance, review the documentation for
notable changes and considerations for each version.

[[upgrade-addons]]
== Upgrade add-ons and components using the Kubernetes API

Before you upgrade a cluster, you should understand what versions of
Kubernetes components you are using. Inventory cluster components, and
identify components that use the Kubernetes API directly. This includes
critical cluster components such as monitoring and logging agents,
cluster autoscalers, container storage drivers
(e.g. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html[EBS
CSI], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html[EFS
CSI]), ingress controllers, and any other workloads or add-ons that rely
on the Kubernetes API directly.

TIP: Critical cluster components are often installed in a
`+*-system+` namespace


....
kubectl get ns | grep '-system'
....

Once you have identified components that rely the Kubernetes API, check
their documentation for version compatibility and upgrade requirements.
For example, see the
https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/deploy/installation/[AWS
Load Balancer Controller] documentation for version compatibility. Some
components may need to be upgraded or configuration changed before
proceeding with a cluster upgrade. Some critical components to check
include https://github.com/coredns/coredns[CoreDNS],
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy[kube-proxy],
https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s[VPC CNI], and storage drivers.

Clusters often contain many workloads that use the Kubernetes API and
are required for workload functionality such as ingress controllers,
continuous delivery systems, and monitoring tools. When you upgrade an
EKS cluster, you must also upgrade your add-ons and third-party tools to
make sure they are compatible.

See the following examples of common add-ons and their relevant upgrade
documentation:

* *Amazon VPC CNI:* For the recommended version of the Amazon VPC CNI
add-on for each cluster version, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-vpc-cni.html[Updating
the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes self-managed add-on]. *When
installed as an Amazon EKS Add-on, it can only be upgraded one minor
version at a time.*
* *kube-proxy:* See
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-kube-proxy.html[Updating
the Kubernetes kube-proxy self-managed add-on].
* *CoreDNS:* See
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-coredns.html[Updating
the CoreDNS self-managed add-on].
* *AWS Load Balancer Controller:* The AWS Load Balancer Controller needs
to be compatible with the EKS version you have deployed. See the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html[installation
guide] for more information.
* *Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Container Storage Interface
(CSI) driver:* For installation and upgrade information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html[Managing
the Amazon EBS CSI driver as an Amazon EKS add-on].
* *Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Container Storage Interface
(CSI) driver:* For installation and upgrade information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html[Amazon EFS
CSI driver].
* *Kubernetes Metrics Server:* For more information, see
https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/[metrics-server] on
GitHub.
* *Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler:* To upgrade the version of Kubernetes
Cluster Autoscaler, change the version of the image in the deployment.
The Cluster Autoscaler is tightly coupled with the Kubernetes scheduler.
You will always need to upgrade it when you upgrade the cluster. Review
the https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases[GitHub releases]
to find the address of the latest release corresponding to your
Kubernetes minor version.
* *Karpenter:* For installation and upgrade information, see the
https://karpenter.sh/docs/upgrading/[Karpenter documentation.]

== Verify basic EKS requirements before upgrading

AWS requires certain resources in your account to complete the upgrade
process. If these resources aren’t present, the cluster cannot be
upgraded. A control plane upgrade requires the following resources:

[arabic]
. Available IP addresses: Amazon EKS requires up to five available IP
addresses from the subnets you specified when you created the cluster in
order to update the cluster. If not, update your cluster configuration
to include new cluster subnets prior to performing the version update.
. EKS IAM role: The control plane IAM role is still present in the
account with the necessary permissions.
. If your cluster has secret encryption enabled, then make sure that the
cluster IAM role has permission to use the AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) key.

[[upgrades-ips, upgrades-ips.title]]
=== Verify available IP addresses

To update the cluster, Amazon EKS requires up to five available IP
addresses from the subnets that you specified when you created your
cluster.

To verify that your subnets have enough IP addresses to upgrade the
cluster you can run the following command:

....
CLUSTER=<cluster name>
aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids \
  $(aws eks describe-cluster --name ${CLUSTER} \
  --query 'cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.subnetIds' \
  --output text) \
  --query 'Subnets[*].[SubnetId,AvailabilityZone,AvailableIpAddressCount]' \
  --output table

----------------------------------------------------
|                  DescribeSubnets                 |
+---------------------------+--------------+-------+
|  subnet-067fa8ee8476abbd6 |  us-east-1a  |  8184 |
|  subnet-0056f7403b17d2b43 |  us-east-1b  |  8153 |
|  subnet-09586f8fb3addbc8c |  us-east-1a  |  8120 |
|  subnet-047f3d276a22c6bce |  us-east-1b  |  8184 |
+---------------------------+--------------+-------+
....

The
https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/blob/master/cmd/cni-metrics-helper/README.md[VPC
CNI Metrics Helper] may be used to create a CloudWatch dashboard for VPC
metrics. Amazon EKS recommends updating the cluster subnets using the
"`UpdateClusterConfiguration`" API prior to beginning a Kubernetes
version upgrade if you are running out of IP addresses in the subnets
initially specified during cluster creation. Please verify that the new
subnets you will be provided:

* belong to same set of AZs that are selected during cluster creation.
* belong to the same VPC provided during cluster creation

Please consider associating additional CIDR blocks if the IP addresses
in the existing VPC CIDR block run out. AWS enables the association of
additional CIDR blocks with your existing cluster VPC, effectively
expanding your IP address pool. This expansion can be accomplished by
introducing additional private IP ranges (RFC 1918) or, if necessary,
public IP ranges (non-RFC 1918). You must add new VPC CIDR blocks and
allow VPC refresh to complete before Amazon EKS can use the new CIDR.
After that, you can update the subnets based on the newly set up CIDR
blocks to the VPC.

=== Verify EKS IAM role

To verify that the IAM role is available and has the correct assume role
policy in your account you can run the following commands:

....
CLUSTER=<cluster name>
ROLE_ARN=$(aws eks describe-cluster --name ${CLUSTER} \
  --query 'cluster.roleArn' --output text)
aws iam get-role --role-name ${ROLE_ARN##*/} \
  --query 'Role.AssumeRolePolicyDocument'
  
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "eks.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
....

== Migrate to EKS Add-ons

Amazon EKS automatically installs add-ons such as the Amazon VPC CNI
plugin for Kubernetes, `+kube-proxy+`, and CoreDNS for every cluster.
Add-ons may be self-managed, or installed as Amazon EKS Add-ons. Amazon
EKS Add-ons is an alternate way to manage add-ons using the EKS API.

You can use Amazon EKS Add-ons to update versions with a single command.
For Example:

....
aws eks update-addon —cluster-name my-cluster —addon-name vpc-cni —addon-version version-number \
--service-account-role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/role-name —configuration-values '{}' —resolve-conflicts PRESERVE
....

Check if you have any EKS Add-ons with:

....
aws eks list-addons --cluster-name <cluster name>
....

WARNING: EKS Add-ons are not automatically upgraded during a control plane upgrade. You must initiate EKS add-on updates, and select the desired version. 

* You are responsible for selecting a compatible version from all available versions. xref:upgrade-addons[Review the guidance on add-on version compatibility.]
* Amazon EKS Add-ons may only be upgraded one minor version at a time. 


https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-add-ons.html[Learn
more about what components are available as EKS Add-ons&#44; and how to
get started.]

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-add-ons-advanced-configuration/[Learn
how to supply a custom configuration to an EKS Add-on.]

== Identify and remediate removed API usage before upgrading the control plane

You should identify API usage of removed APIs before upgrading your EKS
control plane. To do that we recommend using tools that can check a
running cluster or static, rendered Kubernetes manifest files.

Running the check against static manifest files is generally more
accurate. If run against live clusters, these tools may return false
positives.

A deprecated Kubernetes API does not mean the API has been removed. You
should check the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/[Kubernetes
Deprecation Policy] to understand how API removal affects your
workloads.

=== Cluster Insights

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-insights.html[Cluster
Insights] is a feature that provides findings on issues that may impact
the ability to upgrade an EKS cluster to newer versions of Kubernetes.
These findings are curated and managed by Amazon EKS and offer
recommendations on how to remediate them. By leveraging Cluster
Insights, you can minimize the effort spent to upgrade to newer
Kubernetes versions.

To view insights of an EKS cluster, you can run the command:

....
aws eks list-insights --region <region-code> --cluster-name <my-cluster>

{
    "insights": [
        {
            "category": "UPGRADE_READINESS", 
            "name": "Deprecated APIs removed in Kubernetes v1.29", 
            "insightStatus": {
                "status": "PASSING", 
                "reason": "No deprecated API usage detected within the last 30 days."
            }, 
            "kubernetesVersion": "1.29", 
            "lastTransitionTime": 1698774710.0, 
            "lastRefreshTime": 1700157422.0, 
            "id": "123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-579642341238", 
            "description": "Checks for usage of deprecated APIs that are scheduled for removal in Kubernetes v1.29. Upgrading your cluster before migrating to the updated APIs supported by v1.29 could cause application impact."
        }
    ]
}
....

For a more descriptive output about the insight received, you can run
the command:

....
aws eks describe-insight --region <region-code> --id <insight-id> --cluster-name <my-cluster>
....

You also have the option to view insights in the
https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS Console].
After selecting your cluster from the cluster list, insight findings are
located under the `+Upgrade Insights+` tab.

If you find a cluster insight with `+"status": ERROR+`, you must address
the issue prior to performing the cluster upgrade. Run the
`+aws eks describe-insight+` command which will share the following
remediation advice:

Resources affected:

....
"resources": [
      {
        "insightStatus": {
          "status": "ERROR"
        },
        "kubernetesResourceUri": "/apis/policy/v1beta1/podsecuritypolicies/null"
      }
]
....

APIs deprecated:

....
"deprecationDetails": [
      {
        "usage": "/apis/flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta2/flowschemas", 
        "replacedWith": "/apis/flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3/flowschemas", 
        "stopServingVersion": "1.29", 
        "clientStats": [], 
        "startServingReplacementVersion": "1.26"
      }
]
....

Recommended action to take:

....
"recommendation": "Update manifests and API clients to use newer Kubernetes APIs if applicable before upgrading to Kubernetes v1.26."
....

Utilizing cluster insights through the EKS Console or CLI help speed the
process of successfully upgrading EKS cluster versions. Learn more with

=== Kube-no-trouble

https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble[Kube-no-trouble] is an open
source command line utility with the command `+kubent+`. When you run
`+kubent+` without any arguments it will use your current KubeConfig
context and scan the cluster and print a report with what APIs will be
deprecated and removed.

....
kubent

....

It can also be used to scan static manifest files and helm packages. It
is recommended to run `+kubent+` as part of a continuous integration
(CI) process to identify issues before manifests are deployed. Scanning
manifests is also more accurate than scanning live clusters.

Kube-no-trouble provides a sample
https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble/blob/master/docs/k8s-sa-and-role-example.yaml[Service
Account and Role] with the appropriate permissions for scanning the
cluster.

=== Pluto

Another option is https://pluto.docs.fairwinds.com/[pluto] which is
similar to `+kubent+` because it supports scanning a live cluster,
manifest files, helm charts and has a GitHub Action you can include in
your CI process.

....
pluto detect-all-in-cluster

NAME             KIND                VERSION          REPLACEMENT   REMOVED   DEPRECATED   REPL AVAIL  
eks.privileged   PodSecurityPolicy   policy/v1beta1                 false     true         true
....

=== Resources

To verify that your cluster don’t use deprecated APIs before the
upgrade, you should monitor:

* metric `+apiserver_requested_deprecated_apis+` since Kubernetes v1.19:

....
kubectl get --raw /metrics | grep apiserver_requested_deprecated_apis

apiserver_requested_deprecated_apis{group="policy",removed_release="1.25",resource="podsecuritypolicies",subresource="",version="v1beta1"} 1
....

* events in the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html[audit
logs] with `+k8s.io/deprecated+` set to `+true+`:

....
CLUSTER="<cluster_name>"
QUERY_ID=$(aws logs start-query \
 --log-group-name /aws/eks/${CLUSTER}/cluster \
 --start-time $(date -u --date="-30 minutes" "+%s") # or date -v-30M "+%s" on MacOS \
 --end-time $(date "+%s") \
 --query-string 'fields @message | filter `annotations.k8s.io/deprecated`="true"' \
 --query queryId --output text)

echo "Query started (query id: $QUERY_ID), please hold ..." && sleep 5 # give it some time to query

aws logs get-query-results --query-id $QUERY_ID
....

Which will output lines if deprecated APIs are in use:

....
{
    "results": [
        [

== Update Kubernetes workloads. Use kubectl-convert to update manifests

After you have identified what workloads and manifests need to be
updated, you may need to change the resource type in your manifest files
(e.g. PodSecurityPolicies to PodSecurityStandards). This will require
updating the resource specification and additional research depending on
what resource is being replaced.

If the resource type is staying the same but API version needs to be
updated you can use the `+kubectl-convert+` command to automatically
convert your manifest files. For example, to convert an older Deployment
to `+apps/v1+`. For more information, see
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/#install-kubectl-convert-plugin[Install
kubectl convert plugin]on the Kubernetes website.

`+kubectl-convert -f <file> --output-version <group>/<version>+`

== Configure PodDisruptionBudgets and topologySpreadConstraints to ensure availability of your workloads while the data plane is upgraded

Ensure your workloads have the proper
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/#pod-disruption-budgets[PodDisruptionBudgets]
and
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints[topologySpreadConstraints]
to ensure availability of your workloads while the data plane is
upgraded. Not every workload requires the same level of availability so
you need to validate the scale and requirements of your workload.

Make sure workloads are spread in multiple Availability Zones and on
multiple hosts with topology spreads will give a higher level of
confidence that workloads will migrate to the new data plane
automatically without incident.

Here is an example workload that will always have 80% of replicas
available and spread replicas across zones and hosts

....

https://aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/[AWS Resilience Hub] has added
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) as a supported resource.

downtime caused by software, infrastructure, or operational disruptions.

== Use Managed Node Groups or Karpenter to simplify data plane upgrades

Managed Node Groups and Karpenter both simplify node upgrades, but they
take different approaches.

Managed node groups automate the provisioning and lifecycle management
of nodes. This means that you can create, automatically update, or
terminate nodes with a single operation.

In the default configuration, Karpenter automatically creates new nodes
using the latest compatible EKS Optimized AMI. As EKS releases updated
EKS Optimized AMIs or the cluster is upgraded, Karpenter will
automatically start using these images.
xref:enable-node-expiry-for-karpenter-managed-nodes[Karpenter also
implements Node Expiry to update nodes.]

https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodeclasses/[Karpenter can be
configured to use custom AMIs.] If you use custom AMIs with Karpenter,
you are responsible for the version of kubelet.

[[node-compatibility, node-compatibility.title]]
== Confirm version compatibility with existing nodes and the control plane

Before proceeding with a Kubernetes upgrade in Amazon EKS, it’s vital to
ensure compatibility between your managed node groups, self-managed
nodes, and the control plane. Compatibility is determined by the
Kubernetes version you are using, and it varies based on different
scenarios. Tactics:

* *Kubernetes v1.28+* — **** Starting from Kubernetes version 1.28 and
onwards, there’s a more lenient version policy for core components.
Specifically, the supported skew between the Kubernetes API server and
the kubelet has been extended by one minor version, going from n-2 to
n-3. For example, if your EKS control plane version is 1.28, you can
safely use kubelet versions as old as 1.25. This version skew is
supported across
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html[AWS
Fargate],
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html[managed
node groups], and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker.html[self-managed
nodes]. We highly recommend keeping your
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-amis.html[Amazon
Machine Image (AMI)] versions up-to-date for security reasons. Older
kubelet versions might pose security risks due to potential Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), which could outweigh the benefits
of using older kubelet versions.
* *Kubernetes < v1.28* — If you are using a version older than v1.28,
the supported skew between the API server and the kubelet is n-2. For
example, if your EKS version is 1.27, the oldest kubelet version you can
use is 1.25. This version skew is applicable across
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html[AWS
Fargate],
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html[managed
node groups], and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker.html[self-managed
nodes].

== Enable node expiry for Karpenter managed nodes

One way Karpenter implements node upgrades is using the concept of node
expiry. This reduces the planning required for node upgrades. When you
set a value for **ttlSecondsUntilExpired **in your provisioner, this
activates node expiry. After nodes reach the defined age in seconds,
they’re safely drained and deleted. This is true even if they’re in use,
allowing you to replace nodes with newly provisioned upgraded instances.
When a node is replaced, Karpenter uses the latest EKS-optimized AMIs.
For more information, see
https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/deprovisioning/#methods[Deprovisioning]
on the Karpenter website.

Karpenter doesn’t automatically add jitter to this value. To prevent
excessive workload disruption, define a
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/[pod
disruption budget], as shown in Kubernetes documentation.

If you configure **ttlSecondsUntilExpired **on a provisioner, this
applies to existing nodes associated with the provisioner.

== Use Drift feature for Karpenter managed nodes

https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/deprovisioning/#drift[Karpenter’s
Drift feature] can automatically upgrade the Karpenter-provisioned nodes
to stay in-sync with the EKS control plane. Karpenter Drift currently
needs to be enabled using a
https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/settings/#feature-gates[feature
gate]. Karpenter’s default configuration uses the latest EKS-Optimized
AMI for the same major and minor version as the EKS cluster’s control
plane.

After an EKS Cluster upgrade completes, Karpenter’s Drift feature will
detect that the Karpenter-provisioned nodes are using EKS-Optimized AMIs
for the previous cluster version, and automatically cordon, drain, and
replace those nodes. To support pods moving to new nodes, follow
Kubernetes best practices by setting appropriate pod
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/[resource
quotas], and using
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/[pod
disruption budgets] (PDB). Karpenter’s deprovisioning will pre-spin up
replacement nodes based on the pod resource requests, and will respect
the PDBs when deprovisioning nodes.

== Use eksctl to automate upgrades for self-managed node groups

Self managed node groups are EC2 instances that were deployed in your
account and attached to the cluster outside of the EKS service. These
are usually deployed and managed by some form of automation tooling. To
upgrade self-managed node groups you should refer to your tools
documentation.

For example, eksctl supports
https://eksctl.io/usage/managing-nodegroups/#deleting-and-draining[deleting
and draining self-managed nodes.]

Some common tools include:

* https://eksctl.io/usage/nodegroup-upgrade/[eksctl]
* https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/updates_and_upgrades/[kOps]
* https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/node-groups/#self-managed-node-groups[EKS
Blueprints]

== Backup the cluster before upgrading

New versions of Kubernetes introduce significant changes to your Amazon
EKS cluster. After you upgrade a cluster, you can’t downgrade it.

https://velero.io/[Velero] is an community supported open-source tool
that can be used to take backups of existing clusters and apply the
backups to a new cluster.

Note that you can only create new clusters for Kubernetes versions
currently supported by EKS. If the version your cluster is currently
running is still supported and an upgrade fails, you can create a new
cluster with the original version and restore the data plane. Note that
AWS resources, including IAM, are not included in the backup by Velero.
These resources would need to be recreated.

== Restart Fargate deployments after upgrading the control plane

To upgrade Fargate data plane nodes you need to redeploy the workloads.
You can identify which workloads are running on fargate nodes by listing
all pods with the `+-o wide+` option. Any node name that begins with
`+fargate-+` will need to be redeployed in the cluster.

[[bluegreen, bluegreen.title]]
== Evaluate Blue/Green Clusters as an alternative to in-place cluster upgrades

Some customers prefer to do a blue/green upgrade strategy. This can have
benefits, but also includes downsides that should be considered.

Benefits include:

* Possible to change multiple EKS versions at once (e.g. 1.23 to 1.25)
* Able to switch back to the old cluster
* Creates a new cluster which may be managed with newer systems
(e.g. terraform)
* Workloads can be migrated individually

Some downsides include:

* API endpoint and OIDC change which requires updating consumers
(e.g. kubectl and CI/CD)
* Requires 2 clusters to be run in parallel during the migration, which
can be expensive and limit region capacity
* More coordination is needed if workloads depend on each other to be
migrated together
* Load balancers and external DNS cannot easily span multiple clusters

While this strategy is possible to do, it is more expensive than an
in-place upgrade and requires more time for coordination and workload
migrations. It may be required in some situations and should be planned
carefully.

With high degrees of automation and declarative systems like GitOps,
this may be easier to do. You will need to take additional precautions
for stateful workloads so data is backed up and migrated to new
clusters.

cluster upgrade: the blue-green deployment strategy]

or Canary Amazon EKS clusters migration for stateless ArgoCD workloads]

== Track planned major changes in the Kubernetes project — Think ahead

Don’t look only at the next version. Review new versions of Kubernetes
as they are released, and identify major changes. For example, some
applications directly used the docker API, and support for Container
Runtime Interface (CRI) for Docker (also known as Dockershim) was
removed in Kubernetes `+1.24+`. This kind of change requires more time
to prepare for.

Review all documented changes for the version that you’re upgrading to,
and note any required upgrade steps. Also, note any requirements or
procedures that are specific to Amazon EKS managed clusters.

* https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/CHANGELOG[Kubernetes
changelog]

== Specific Guidance on Feature Removals

=== Removal of Dockershim in 1.25 - Use Detector for Docker Socket (DDS)

The EKS Optimized AMI for 1.25 no longer includes support for
Dockershim. If you have a dependency on Dockershim, e.g. you are
mounting the Docker socket, you will need to remove those dependencies
before upgrading your worker nodes to 1.25.

Find instances where you have a dependency on the Docker socket before
upgrading to 1.25. We recommend using
https://github.com/aws-containers/kubectl-detector-for-docker-socket[Detector
for Docker Socket (DDS)&#44; a kubectl plugin.].

=== Removal of PodSecurityPolicy in 1.25 - Migrate to Pod Security Standards or a policy-as-code solution

`+PodSecurityPolicy+` was
https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/[deprecated
in Kubernetes 1.21], and has been removed in Kubernetes 1.25. If you are
using PodSecurityPolicy in your cluster, then you must migrate to the
built-in Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (PSS) or to a policy-as-code
solution before upgrading your cluster to version 1.25 to avoid
interruptions to your workloads.

AWS published a
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-security-policy-removal-faq.html[detailed
FAQ in the EKS documentation.]

Review the
https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/[PodSecurityPolicy
Deprecation blog post] on the Kubernetes website.

=== Deprecation of In-Tree Storage Driver in 1.23 - Migrate to Container Storage Interface (CSI) Drivers

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) was designed to help Kubernetes
replace its existing, in-tree storage driver mechanisms. The Amazon EBS
container storage interface (CSI) migration feature is enabled by
default in Amazon EKS `+1.23+` and later clusters. If you have pods
running on a version `+1.22+` or earlier cluster, then you must install
the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html[Amazon
EBS CSI driver] before updating your cluster to version `+1.23+` to
avoid service interruption.

Amazon EKS Auto Mode represents a significant evolution in Kubernetes infrastructure management, combining secure and scalable cluster infrastructure with integrated Kubernetes capabilities managed by AWS . The service provides fully-managed worker node operations, eliminating the need for customers to set up Managed Node Groups or AutoScaling groups . 

The key architectural difference is that EKS Auto Mode uses a Karpenter-based system that automatically provisions EC2 instances in response to pod requests . These instances run on Bottlerocket AMIs with pre-installed add-ons like EBS CSI drivers, making the infrastructure truly managed by AWS . In contrast to traditional scaling methods:

* Traditional Cluster Autoscaler (CAS) requires manual node group management and can only create nodes with a single instance type per node group 
* Self-managed Karpenter offers more flexibility by working with EC2 Fleet API and can provision different instance types, but requires customer management 
* EKS Auto Mode handles all scaling operations automatically through managed NodePools and NodeClasses


The new system introduces several operational improvements:

* Automatic pod-driven scaling without manual node group configuration 
* Built-in managed load balancer controllers that automatically create ALB/NLB based on Ingress resources 
* Integrated security features with pre-configured Pod identity Maximum node runtime of 21 days with automatic replacement 
* Maximum node runtime of 21 days with automatic replacement


From a cost perspective, EKS Auto Mode maintains standard EC2 pricing while adding a management fee only for Auto Mode-managed nodes. Importantly, customers can still mix Auto Mode managed nodes with self-managed nodes in the same cluster . 

While AWS handles most operational aspects, customers retain responsibility for cluster version management and can perform controlled upgrades that trigger rolling updates of worker nodes . 

== Reasons to use Auto Mode

Auto Mode is geared towards users that want the benefits of Kubernetes and EKS but need to minimize operational burden around Kubernetes like upgrades and installation/maintenance of critical platform pieces like auto-scaling, load balancing, and storage.  Auto Mode takes EKS a step further in the minimization of the undifferentiated heavy lifting that goes along with Kubernetes maintenance



== Components

EKS Auto Mode completely automates the deployment most of the pieces of a data plane needed for production-grade Kubernetes.  This includes:

* Karpenter, for auto-scaling the compute of your cluster
* AWS Load Balancer Controller to allow you to easily expose Kubernetes services via automated Elastic Load Balancer integration
* EBS CSI
* VPC CNI
* EKS Pod Identity Agent



== Configuring NodePools in EKS Auto Mode

A new cluster will come pre-configured with two NodePools


=== general-purpose

This NodePool instructs Karpenter to launch nodes with the following characteristics:

1. Capacity Type of “On Demand”
2. Instance Types of C, M, or R
3. Instance Generation of 4
4. AMD architecture
5. Linux OS


It also defines what the scale down logic is by declaring that only 10% of all nodes may be in a disrupted state at any given time and that consolidation should only occur when nodes are empty or underutilized.


=== system

This NodePool is similar to “general-purpose” except for the following differences:

1. It allows for nodes with the ARM architecture as well as AMD architecture
2. It taints these nodes with a NoSchedule unless there’s a toleration for “CriticalAddonsOnly”.  This is for internal use by EKS add-ons

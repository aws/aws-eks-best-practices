= Container image scanning
:info_doctype: section

Image Scanning is an automated vulnerability assessment feature that helps improve the security of your application's container images by scanning them for a broad range of operating system vulnerabilities.

Currently, the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is only able to scan Linux container image for vulnerabilities. However; there are third-party tools which can be integrated with an existing CI/CD pipeline for Windows container image scanning.

:info_titleabbrev: Hardening Windows containers images
:imagesdir: images/windows/

Are you hardening your Windows container images? Over the years, I've worked with customers globally to help them migrate legacy workloads to containers, particularly Windows workloads. With more than 20 years of experience, I've seen organizations dedicate substantial effort and resources to hardening their Windows Servers, implementing everything from CIS Benchmarks to runtime antivirus protection to safeguard sensitive data.

However, a concerning trend has emerged. As these highly secure virtual machines are modernized into containers, many critical hardening practices are being overlooked. Windows security best practices, from the base image (OS) to web services such as IIS, are often neglected, with most of the focus placed solely on securing the container host. It's vital to recognize that while containers operate in isolated namespaces, they still share kernel primitives with the host. Attackers are typically more interested in lateral movement rather than targeting the container host directly, allowing them to exploit weak container security settings and access sensitive data.

The goal of the documentations is to highlight a few essential security settings you should implement specifically for Windows containers hosting `ASP.NET` websites on IIS. We'll focus on four key areas:

* Account security policies
* Audit policies
* IIS security best practices
* Principle of least privilege

We'll start by delving into why each of these security configurations is vital for protecting your Windows containers, examining the specific risks they mitigate and the security benefits they provide. Next, we'll walk through a code snippet that demonstrates how to implement these configurations correctly in your Dockerfile, ensuring your container is hardened against potential threats. Finally, we'll break down each setting in detail, offering a comprehensive explanation of its function, impact on container security, and how it contributes to safeguarding your applications. This approach will not only show you how to apply these best practices but also give you the insight to understand why they are essential for maintaining a robust security posture in containerized environments.


== 1. Configure Account Policies (Password or Lockout) using Local Security Policies and Registry

Windows Server Core is a minimal installation option that is available as part of the [EKS Optimized Windows AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/Configuring Account Policies (Password or Lockout) using Local Security Policies and the Registry strengthens system security by enforcing robust password and lockout rules. These policies require users to create strong passwords with a defined minimum length and complexity, protecting against common password-related attacks.

By setting a maximum password age, users are prompted to regularly update their passwords, reducing the likelihood of compromised credentials. Lockout policies add an extra layer of protection by temporarily locking accounts after a specified number of failed login attempts, helping to prevent brute-force attacks. Configuring these settings via the Windows Registry allows administrators to enforce these security measures at the system level, ensuring uniformity and compliance throughout the organization. Applying these Account Policies in a Windows Container is essential for maintaining security consistency, even though containers are often ephemeral and intended for isolated workloads:


=== Security Consistency

* Compliance: Enforcing consistent password policies and lockout rules in containers helps maintain security compliance, especially in environments that require strict access controls (e.g., regulatory compliance such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
* Hardened Containers: Applying these settings ensures that your Windows container is hardened against unauthorized access or password-based attacks, aligning the security posture of your container with the broader system security policies.


=== Protection Against Brute Force Attacks

* Account Lockout: These settings help defend against brute force login attempts by locking accounts after a specific number of failed login attempts. This prevents attackers from trying an unlimited number of passwords.
* Password Complexity: Requiring complex passwords with sufficient length reduces the likelihood of weak passwords being exploited, even in isolated containerized environments.


=== Multi-User Scenarios

* If your containerized application is designed to handle multiple users or requires user authentication, enforcing password policies ensures that user accounts within the container adhere to strict security rules, limiting access to only authorized users.


=== Persistent Windows Containers

* While containers are generally considered ephemeral, certain Windows containers can run long-term services or handle user management, making it important to enforce proper security policies similar to a regular Windows server.


=== Consistency in Hybrid Environments

* If you are running both virtual machines and containers in your infrastructure, applying the same security policies (e.g., password/lockout policies) across all environments ensures uniform security standards, simplifying governance and management.

In summary, applying these account policies within Windows containers ensures that your containers are not a weak point in your security strategy, protecting against password attacks and enforcing consistency across your entire environment.

Dockerfile:

----
# Configure account policies for password complexity and lockout
RUN powershell -Command \
      "Write-Output 'Configuring Account Policies (Password/Lockout)...'; \
      NET ACCOUNTS /MINPWLEN:14 /MAXPWAGE:60 /MINPWAGE:14 /LOCKOUTTHRESHOLD:5
----

*Explanation:*

This section configures account policies for password and lockout settings via the Windows Registry. These policies help enforce security by controlling password requirements and account lockout thresholds.

. *MinimumPasswordLength (MINPWLEN) = 14*
 This setting defines the minimum number of characters for a password. The range is 0-14 characters; the default is six characters.
. *MaximumPasswordAge (MAXPWAGE) = 60*
 This setting defines the maximum number of days that a password is valid. No limit is specified by using UNLIMITED. /MAXPWAGE can't be less than /MINPWAGE. The range is 1-999; the default is 90 days
. *Lockout Threshold (LOCKOUTTHRESHOLD) = 5*
 This setting defines the threshold for failed login attempts. After 5 incorrect attempts, the account will be locked.

These settings help improve password security and prevent brute force attacks by enforcing strong password policies and locking out accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.


== 2. Audit policies

Audit Policies are important for Windows Containers because they provide critical visibility into security events, such as login attempts and privilege use, helping to detect unauthorized access, monitor user activity, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Even in the ephemeral nature of containers, audit logs are essential for incident investigation, proactive threat detection, and maintaining a consistent security posture across containerized environments.

*Security Monitoring and Compliance:*

* Track User Activities: Audit policies allow administrators to monitor user activities, such as login attempts and privilege use, within the container. This is critical for detecting unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
* Regulatory Compliance: Many organizations are required to log security events for compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR. Enabling audit policies in containers ensures you meet these requirements, even in containerized environments.

*Incident Investigation:*

* Forensics and Analysis: If a containerized application or service is compromised, audit logs can provide valuable insights for post-incident analysis. They help security teams trace the actions taken by attackers or identify how a breach occurred.
* Real-time Detection: Audit logs allow administrators to set up real-time alerts for critical events (e.g., failed login attempts, privilege escalations). This proactive monitoring helps detect attacks early and enables faster response times.

*Consistency Across Environments:*

* Uniform Security Posture: By applying audit policies in containers via the registry, you ensure consistent security practices across both containerized and non-containerized environments. This avoids containers becoming a blind spot for security monitoring.
* Visibility in Hybrid Environments: For organizations running both traditional Windows servers and containers, auditing policies provide similar visibility and control across all platforms, making management easier and more effective.

*Tracking Privileged Operations:*

* Privilege Use Auditing: In container environments where applications run with elevated privileges or where administrative tasks are performed, auditing privileged operations ensures accountability. You can log who accessed sensitive resources or performed critical tasks inside the container.
* Prevent Abuse of Privileges: By monitoring privilege use, you can detect when unauthorized users try to elevate their privileges or access restricted areas within the container, which helps prevent internal or external attacks.

*Detecting Unauthorized Access Attempts:*

* Failed Logon Attempts: Enabling audit policies for failed login attempts helps identify brute-force attacks or unauthorized attempts to access containerized applications. This provides visibility into who is trying to gain access to the system and how often.
* Account Lockout Monitoring: Auditing account lockout events allows administrators to detect and investigate potential lockouts caused by suspicious or malicious activity.

*Persistent Security Even in Ephemeral Environments:*

* Ephemeral Yet Secure: While containers are ephemeral, meaning they can be deleted and recreated frequently, auditing still plays a key role in ensuring that security events are captured while the container is running. This ensures that critical security events are logged for the duration of the container's lifecycle.

*Centralized Logging:*

* Forwarding Logs to Centralized Systems: Containers can be integrated with centralized logging systems (e.g., ELK stack, AWS CloudWatch) to capture audit logs from multiple container instances. This allows for better analysis and correlation of security events across your infrastructure.

Dockerfile:

----
# Configure audit policies for logging security events
RUN powershell -Command \
    "Write-Host 'Configuring Audit Policy..'; \
    Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa' -Name 'SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy' -Value 0; \
    auditpol /set /category:"Logon/Logoff" /subcategory:"Logon" /failure:enable

# Creates STDOUT on Windows Containers (check GitHub LogMonitor:: https://github.com/microsoft/windows-container-tools/blob/main/LogMonitor/README.md)
COPY LogMonitor.exe LogMonitorConfig.json 'C:\\LogMonitor\\'
WORKDIR /LogMonitor
----

*Explanation:*

This section configures audit policies by using registry modifications. Audit policies control what security events are logged by Windows, which helps in monitoring and detecting unauthorized access attempts.

. *SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy = 0*
 This disables the legacy audit policy format, enabling more granular auditing policies introduced in later versions of Windows. This is important for modern audit configurations.
. *Auditpol Subcategory: "`Logon`"*
 This setting enables auditing for both success and failure logon events. The value 3 means that Windows will log both successful and failed logon attempts. This helps in monitoring who is accessing the system and catching failed login attempts.

These audit policies are critical for security monitoring and compliance, as they provide detailed logs of important security events such as login attempts and the use of privileged operations.


== 3. IIS Security best practices for Windows containers

Implementing IIS best practices in Windows Containers is important for several reasons, ensuring that your applications are secure, high performance, and scalable. Although containers provide isolation and a lightweight environment, they still require proper configuration to avoid vulnerabilities and operational issues. Here's why following best practices for IIS in Windows Containers is crucial:

*Security*

* Preventing Common Vulnerabilities: IIS is often a target for attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and information disclosure. Implementing security headers (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security) helps protect your application from these threats.
* Isolation Isn't Enough: Containers are isolated, but a misconfigured IIS instance can expose sensitive information, such as server version details, directory listings, or unencrypted communications. By disabling features such as directory browsing and removing the IIS version header, you minimize the attack surface.
* Encryption and HTTPS: Best practices, such as enforcing HTTPS-only connections, ensure that data in transit is encrypted, protecting sensitive information from being intercepted.

*Performance*

* Efficient Resource Usage: IIS best practices such as enabling dynamic and static compression reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times. These optimizations are especially important in containerized environments, where resources are shared across containers and the host system.
* Optimized Logging: Properly configuring logging (e.g., including the X-Forwarded-For header) ensures that you can trace client activity while minimizing unnecessary logging overhead. This helps you gather relevant data for troubleshooting without degrading performance.

*Scalability and Maintainability*

* Consistency Across Environments: By following best practices, you ensure that your IIS configuration is consistent across multiple container instances. This simplifies scaling and makes sure that when new containers are deployed, they adhere to the same security and performance guidelines.
* Automated Configurations: Best practices in Dockerfiles, such as setting folder permissions and disabling unnecessary features, ensure that each new container is automatically configured correctly. This reduces manual intervention and lowers the risk of human error.

*Compliance*

* Meeting Regulatory Requirements: Many industries have strict regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA) that mandate specific security measures, such as encrypted communications (HTTPS) and logging of client requests. Following IIS best practices in containers helps ensure compliance with these standards.
* Auditability: Implementing audit policies and secure logging allows for the traceability of events, which is critical in audits. For example, logging the X-Forwarded-For header ensures that client IP addresses are recorded correctly in proxy-based architectures.

*Minimizing Risk in Shared Environments*

* Avoiding Misconfigurations: Containers share the host's kernel, and while they are isolated from one another, a poorly configured IIS instance could expose vulnerabilities or create performance bottlenecks. Best practices ensure that each IIS instance runs optimally, reducing the risk of cross-container issues.
* Least Privilege Access: Setting proper permissions for folders and files within the container (e.g., using Set-Acl in PowerShell) ensures that users and processes within the container only have the necessary access, reducing the risk of privilege escalation or data tampering.

*Resilience in Ephemeral Environments*

* Ephemeral Nature of Containers: Containers are often short-lived and rebuilt frequently. Applying IIS best practices ensures that each container is configured securely and consistently, regardless of how many times it is redeployed. This prevents misconfigurations from being introduced over time.
* Mitigating Potential Misconfigurations: By automatically enforcing best practices (e.g., disabling weak protocols or headers), the risk of a misconfiguration during container restarts or updates is minimized.

----

Explanation:

This command configures IIS to log the X-Forwarded-For header, which is commonly used to capture the original client IP address when a request passes through a proxy or load balancer. By default, IIS only logs the IP address of the load balancer or reverse proxy, so adding this custom log field helps track the true client IP for security auditing, analytics, and troubleshooting.

. *X-Forwarded-For header* which is commonly used to capture the original client IP address when a request passes through a proxy or load balancer. By default, IIS only logs the IP address of the load balancer or reverse proxy, so adding this custom log field helps track the true client IP for security auditing, analytics, and troubleshooting.
. *Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)*
  Ensures browsers only communicate over HTTPS. The max-age=31536000 specifies that this policy is enforced for 1 year, and includeSubDomains applies the policy to all subdomains.
. *X-Content-Type-Options*
 Prevents browsers from "`MIME-sniffing`" a response away from the declared Content-Type. This helps prevent some types of attacks.
. *X-XSS-Protection*
 Enables Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection in browsers.
. *X-Frame-Options*
 Prevents the page from being embedded in iframes, protecting against clickjacking attacks.
. *Disable IIS version disclosure*
 This command disables the Server header in HTTP responses, which by default reveals the version of IIS being used. Hiding this information helps reduce the risk of attackers identifying and targeting vulnerabilities specific to the IIS version.
. *Enable HTTPS-only connections*
 This (commented-out) section enforces HTTPS connections and disables HTTP. If uncommented, the Dockerfile will configure IIS to listen only on port 443 (HTTPS) and remove the default HTTP binding on port 80. This is useful when terminating SSL inside the container and ensures that all traffic is encrypted.
. *Disable Directory Browsing*
 Prevents IIS from showing a directory listing when no default document is present. This avoids exposing the internal file structure to users.
. *Pass Through Custom Error Pages*
 Ensures that if the application has its own error handling, IIS will let the application's error pages pass through instead of showing default IIS error pages.
. *Detailed Error Mode*
Configures IIS to display detailed error messages for local requests only, helping developers diagnose issues without exposing sensitive information to external users.
. *Ensure Proper Folder Permissions*
This block configures folder permissions for the IIS web root (C:\inetpub\wwwroot). It sets Read and Execute permissions for the IIS_IUSRS and Users groups, ensuring that these users can access the folder but not modify files. Setting the correct permissions minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or tampering with the files hosted by the web server.

Following IIS best practices in Windows Containers ensures that your containerized applications are secure, high performance, and scalable. These practices help prevent vulnerabilities, optimize resource usage, ensure compliance, and maintain consistency across container instances. Even though containers are designed to be isolated, proper configuration is necessary to minimize risks and ensure the reliability of your application in production environments.


== 4. Principle of Least Privilege

The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is crucial for Windows containers for several important reasons, particularly in enhancing security and minimizing risks within containerized environments. This principle dictates that a system or application should operate with the minimum level of permissions necessary to function properly. Here's why it's important in Windows containers:

*Minimizing Attack Surface*

* Containers often run applications that interact with various system components, and the more privileges an application has, the broader its access to those components. By limiting the container's permissions to only what's necessary, PoLP significantly reduces the attack surface, making it harder for an attacker to exploit the container if it becomes compromised.

*Limiting the Impact of Compromised Containers*

* If a Windows container is compromised, running applications with excessive privileges (e.g., Administrator or root-level access) could allow an attacker to gain control over critical system files or escalate privileges across the container host. By enforcing PoLP, even if a container is breached, the attacker is limited in what they can do, preventing further escalation and access to sensitive resources or other containers.

*Protection in Multitenant Environments*

* In cloud or enterprise environments, multiple containers can be running on the same physical or virtual infrastructure. PoLP ensures that a compromised container doesn't have the ability to access resources or data belonging to other tenants. This isolation is crucial for maintaining security in shared, multitenant environments, protecting against lateral movement between containers.

*Mitigating Privilege Escalation*

* Containers that run with high privileges can be used by attackers to escalate privileges within the system. PoLP mitigates this risk by restricting the container's access to system resources, thereby preventing unauthorized actions or privilege escalations beyond the container's environment.

*Compliance and Auditing*

* Many regulatory standards and security frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) require systems to adhere to PoLP to limit access to sensitive data. Running Windows containers with restricted privileges helps organizations comply with these regulations and ensures that applications are only granted access to the resources they specifically need.

*Reducing the Risk of Misconfiguration*

* When containers run with unnecessary privileges, even a minor misconfiguration can lead to severe security vulnerabilities. For example, if a container running as Administrator is accidentally exposed to the internet, an attacker could gain control of the system. PoLP helps prevent such risks by defaulting to limited privileges, making misconfigurations less dangerous.

*Improved Container Security Posture*

* By following PoLP, containers are better isolated from the underlying host system and from each other. This ensures that the containerized application is less likely to access or modify system files or processes outside its defined scope, preserving the integrity of the host operating system and other workloads.

Dockerfile:

----
# Strongly recommended that when deploying a Windows server container to any multi-tenant environment that your application runs via the ContainerUser account
USER ContainerUser
----

*Explanation:*

In this section, the USER ContainerUser command specifies that the application inside the Windows container should run under the ContainerUser account instead of the default Administrator account.

Here's why this is important, especially in a multitenant environment:

. *Principle of Least Privilege*: The ContainerUser account is a non-administrative user with limited privileges. Running the application under this account adheres to the principle of least privilege, which helps minimize the risk of exploitation. If an attacker were to compromise the application, they would have limited access to the system, reducing the potential damage.
. *Enhanced Security*: In multitenant environments, containers can share the same underlying infrastructure. Running as ContainerUser ensures that even if one container is compromised, it won't have administrative privileges to access or modify critical system files or other containers. This reduces the attack surface significantly.
. *Avoiding Root Access*: By default, containers might run with elevated permissions (similar to root access in Linux containers), which can be dangerous if exploited. Using ContainerUser ensures that the application doesn't run with unnecessary administrative rights, making it harder for attackers to escalate privileges.
. *Best Practice for Multitenant Environments*: In environments where multiple users or organizations share the same infrastructure (such as in the cloud), security is critical. Running applications with restricted permissions prevents one tenant's application from affecting others, protecting sensitive data and resources across the platform.

The *USER ContainerUser* command ensures that the application runs with minimal privileges, enhancing security in multitenant environments by limiting the damage that could be done if the container is compromised. This is a best practice to prevent unauthorized access or privilege escalation in a containerized environment.

The Principle of Least Privilege is essential for Windows containers because it limits the potential impact of security breaches, reduces the attack surface, and prevents unauthorized access to critical system components. By running containerized applications with only the necessary permissions, organizations can significantly enhance the security and stability of their container environments, especially in multitenant and shared infrastructures.


== Final Thoughts: Why Securing Your Windows Containers is a Must-Have in Today's Threat Landscape

In today's fast-evolving digital world, where threats are becoming more sophisticated and abundant, securing your Windows containers is not just a recommendation, it's an absolute necessity. Containers provide a lightweight, flexible way to package and deploy applications, but they are not immune to security vulnerabilities. As more businesses adopt containers to streamline their infrastructure, they also become a potential target for cyberattacks if not properly secured.

The internet is flooded with various threats--ranging from malicious actors targeting unpatched vulnerabilities to automated bots scanning for misconfigurations. Without the right security measures in place, containers can be exploited to expose sensitive data, escalate privileges, or serve as entry points for attacks that can compromise your broader infrastructure. This makes container security as critical as securing any other part of your environment.

When using Windows containers, many traditional security best practices still apply. Implementing robust account policies, securing IIS configurations, enforcing HTTPS, using strict firewall rules, and applying least privilege access to critical files are all key measures that ensure the container remains resilient against attacks. Additionally, regular auditing and logging provide visibility into what's happening inside the container, allowing you to catch suspicious activity before it turns into a full-blown incident.

Securing Windows containers also aligns with regulatory requirements that mandate protecting sensitive data and ensuring application integrity. As cloud-native and containerized architectures become more prevalent, ensuring security at every layer, from the base image to the running container, will help safeguard your operations and maintain customer trust.

In summary, the rise of containerized applications, coupled with the growing number of cyber threats, makes container security a nonnegotiable aspect of modern infrastructure management. By adhering to best practices and continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities, businesses can enjoy the agility and efficiency of Windows containers without compromising on security. In this threat-rich environment, securing your Windows containers is not just an option--it's a must-have.

It is responsible for ensuring that your cluster has enough nodes to schedule your pods without wasting resources. It watches for pods that fail to schedule and for nodes that are underutilized. It then simulates the addition or removal of nodes before applying the change to your cluster. The AWS Cloud Provider implementation within Cluster Autoscaler controls the <code>.DesiredReplicas</code> field of your EC2 Auto Scaling Groups.</p> <p></p> <p>This guide will provide a mental model for configuring the Cluster Autoscaler and choosing the best set of tradeoffs to meet your organization's requirements. While there is no single best configuration, there are a set of configuration options that enable you to trade off performance, scalability, cost, and availability. Additionally, this guide will provide tips and best practices for optimizing your configuration for AWS.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"<p>The following terminology will be used frequently throughout this document. These terms can have broad meaning, but are limited to the definitions below for the purposes of this document.</p> <p>Scalability refers to how well the Cluster Autoscaler performs as your Kubernetes Cluster increases in number of pods and nodes. As scalability limits are reached, the Cluster Autoscaler's performance and functionality degrades. As the Cluster Autoscaler exceeds its scalability limits, it may no longer add or remove nodes in your cluster.</p> <p>Performance refers to how quickly the Cluster Autoscaler is able to make and execute scaling decisions. A perfectly performing Cluster Autoscaler would instantly make a decision and trigger a scaling action in response to stimuli, such as a pod becoming unschedulable.</p> <p>Availability means that pods can be scheduled quickly and without disruption. This includes when newly created pods need to be scheduled and when a scaled down node terminates any remaining pods scheduled to it.</p> <p>Cost is determined by the decision behind scale out and scale in events. Resources are wasted if an existing node is underutilized or a new node is added that is too large for incoming pods. Depending on the use case, there can be costs associated with prematurely terminating pods due to an aggressive scale down decision.</p> <p>Node Groups are an abstract Kubernetes concept for a group of nodes within a cluster.  It is not a true Kubernetes resource, but exists as an abstraction in the Cluster Autoscaler, Cluster API, and other components. Nodes within a Node Group share properties like labels and taints, but may consist of multiple Availability Zones or Instance Types.</p> <p>EC2 Auto Scaling Groups can be used as an implementation of Node Groups on EC2. EC2 Auto Scaling Groups are configured to launch instances that automatically join their Kubernetes Clusters and apply labels and taints to their corresponding Node resource in the Kubernetes API.</p> <p>EC2 Managed Node Groups are another implementation of Node Groups on EC2. They abstract away the complexity manually configuring EC2 Autoscaling Scaling Groups and provide additional management features like node version upgrade and graceful node termination.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#operating-the-cluster-autoscaler","title":"Operating the Cluster Autoscaler","text":"<p>The Cluster Autoscaler is typically installed as a Deployment in your cluster.

Insufficient Capacity Errors will occur when your EC2 Auto Scaling group cannot scale up due to lack of available capacity. Maximizing diversity by selecting many instance families can increase your chance of achieving your desired scale by tapping into many Spot capacity pools, and decrease the impact of Spot Instance interruptions on your cluster availability. Mixed Instance Policies with Spot Instances are a great way to increase diversity without increasing the number of node groups. Keep in mind, if you need guaranteed resources, use On-Demand Instances instead of Spot Instances.</p> <p>It's critical that all Instance Types have similar resource capacity when configuring Mixed Instance Policies. The autoscaler's scheduling simulator uses the first InstanceType in the MixedInstancePolicy. If subsequent Instance Types are larger, resources may be wasted after a scale up. If smaller, your pods may fail to schedule on the new instances due to insufficient capacity. For example, M4, M5, M5a, and M5n instances all have similar amounts of CPU and Memory and are great candidates for a MixedInstancePolicy. The EC2 Instance Selector tool can help you identify similar instance types.</p> <p></p> <p>It's recommended to isolate On-Demand and Spot capacity into separate EC2 Auto Scaling groups. This is preferred over using a base capacity strategy because the scheduling properties are fundamentally different. Since Spot Instances be interrupted at any time (when EC2 needs the capacity back), users will often taint their preemptable nodes, requiring an explicit pod toleration to the preemption behavior. These taints result in different scheduling properties for the nodes, so they should be separated into multiple EC2 Auto Scaling Groups.</p> <p>The Cluster Autoscaler has a concept of Expanders, which provide different strategies for selecting which Node Group to scale. The strategy <code>--expander=least-waste</code> is a good general purpose default, and if you're going to use multiple node groups for Spot Instance diversification (as described in the image above), it could help further cost-optimize the node groups by scaling the group which would be best utilized after the scaling activity.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#prioritizing-a-node-group-asg","title":"Prioritizing a node group / ASG","text":"<p>You may also configure priority based autoscaling by using the Priority expander. <code>--expander=priority</code> enables your cluster to prioritize a node group / ASG, and if it is unable to scale for any reason, it will choose the next node group in the prioritized list.

This value defaults to 15 minutes and can be reduced for more responsive node group selection, though if the value is too low, it can cause unnecessary scale outs.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#overprovisioning","title":"Overprovisioning","text":"<p>The Cluster Autoscaler minimizes costs by ensuring that nodes are only added to the cluster when needed and are removed when unused. This significantly impacts deployment latency because many pods will be forced to wait for a node scale up before they can be scheduled. Nodes can take multiple minutes to become available, which can increase pod scheduling latency by an order of magnitude.</p> <p>This can be mitigated using overprovisioning, which trades cost for scheduling latency. Overprovisioning is implemented using temporary pods with negative priority, which occupy space in the cluster. When newly created pods are unschedulable and have higher priority, the temporary pods will be preempted to make room. The temporary pods then become unschedulable, triggering the Cluster Autoscaler to scale out new overprovisioned nodes.</p> <p>There are other less obvious benefits to overprovisioning. Without overprovisioning, one of the side effects of a highly utilized cluster is that pods will make less optimal scheduling decisions using the <code>preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</code> rule of Pod or Node Affinity. A common use case for this is to separate pods for a highly available application across availability zones using AntiAffinity. Overprovisioning can significantly increase the chance that a node of the correct zone is available.</p> <p>The amount of overprovisioned capacity is a careful business decision for your organization. At its core, it's a tradeoff between performance and cost. One way to make this decision is to determine your average scale up frequency and divide it by the amount of time it takes to scale up a new node. For example, if on average you require a new node every 30 seconds and EC2 takes 30 seconds to provision a new node, a single node of overprovisioning will ensure that there's always an extra node available, reducing scheduling latency by 30 seconds at the cost of a single additional EC2 Instance. To improve zonal scheduling decisions, overprovision a number of nodes equal to the number of availability zones in your EC2 Auto Scaling Group to ensure that the scheduler can select the best zone for incoming pods.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#prevent-scale-down-eviction","title":"Prevent Scale Down Eviction","text":"<p>Some workloads are expensive to evict.

In addition, dependencies, such as instance size and storage selection, may effect workload performance which can have a variety of unintended consequences on costs and reliability.</p> <p>Requests should align with the actual utilization. If a container's requests are too high there will be unused capacity which is a large factor in total cluster costs. Each container in a pod, e.g. application and sidecars, should have their own requests and limits set to make sure the aggregate pod limits are as accurate as possible.</p> <p>Utilize tools such as Goldilocks, KRR, and Kubecost which estimate resource requests and limits for your containers. Depending on the nature of the applications, performance/cost requirements, and complexity you need to evaluate which metrics are best to scale on, at what point your application performance degrades (saturation point), and how to tweak request and limits accordingly. Please refer to Application right sizing for further guidance on this topic.</p> <p>We recommend using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to control how many replicas of your application should be running, the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to adjust how many requests and limits your application needs per replica, and a node autoscaler like Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler to continually adjust the total number of nodes in your cluster. Cost optimization techniques using Karpenter and Cluster Autoscaler are documented in a later section of this document.</p> <p>The Vertical Pod Autoscaler can adjust the requests and limits assigned to containers so workloads run optimally. You should run the VPA in auditing mode so it does not automatically make changes and restart your pods. It will suggest changes based on observed metrics.

Its important to consider that restrictive PodDisruptionBudgets can prevent Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter from scaling down Nodes, since both Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter respect PodDisruptionBudgets. The 'minAvailable' value in the PodDisruptionBudget should always be lower than the number of pods in the deployment and you should keep a good buffer between the two e.g. In a deployment of 6 pods where you want a minimum of 4 pods running at all times, set the 'minAvailable' in your PodDisruptionBidget to 4. This will allow Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter to safely drain and evict pods from the under-utilized nodes during a Node scale-down event.

As the diagram above depicts, Services are the stable network abstraction layer that receive traffic destined for your Pods. When a Service is created, multiple EndpointSlices are created. Each EndpointSlice has a list of endpoints containing a subset of Pod addresses along with the nodes they're running on and any additional topology information. <code>kube-proxy</code> is a daemonset that runs on every node in your cluster and also fulfills a role of internal routing, but it does so based on what it consumes from the created EndpointSlices.</p> <p>When topology aware routing is enabled and implemented on a Kubernetes Service, the EndpointSlice controller will proportionally allocate endpoints to the different zones that your cluster is spread across. For each of those endpoints, the EndpointSlice controller will also set a hint for the zone. Hints describe which zone an endpoint should serve traffic for. <code>kube-proxy</code> will then route traffic from a zone to an endpoint based on the hints that get applied. </p> <p>The diagram below shows how EndpointSlices with hints are organized in such a way that <code>kube-proxy</code> can know what destination they should go to based on their zonal point of origin. Without hints, there is no such allocation or organization and traffic will be proxied to different zonal destinations regardless of where it's coming from. </p> <p></p> <p>In some cases, the EndpointSlice controller may apply a hint for a different zone, meaning the endpoint could end up serving traffic originating from a different zone. The reason for this is to try and maintain an even distribution of traffic between endpoints in different zones.</p> <p>Below is a code snippet on how to enable topology aware routing for a Service. </p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: orders-service\n  namespace: ecommerce\n    annotations:\n      service.kubernetes.io/topology-mode: Auto\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: orders\n  type: ClusterIP\n  ports:\n  - protocol: TCP\n    port: 3003\n    targetPort: 3003\n</code></pre> <p>The screenshot below shows the result of the EndpointSlice controller having successfully applied a hint to an endpoint for a Pod replica running in the AZ <code>eu-west-1a</code>. </p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>It's important to note that topology aware routing is still in beta. Also, this feature is more predictable when workloads are widely and evenly distributed across the cluster topology. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use it in conjunction with scheduling constraints that increase the availability of an application such as pod topology spread constraints.</p> <p>Using Autoscalers: Provision Nodes to a Specific AZ</p> <p>We strongly recommend running your workloads in highly available environments across multiple AZs. This improves the reliability of your applications, especially when there is an incident of an issue with an AZ. In the case you're willing to sacrifice reliability for the sake of reducing their network-related costs, you can restrict your nodes to a single AZ. </p> <p>To run all your Pods in the same AZ, either provision the worker nodes in the same AZ or schedule the Pods on the worker nodes running on the same AZ. To provision nodes within a single AZ, define a node group with subnets belonging to the same AZ with Cluster Autoscaler (CA). For Karpenter, use \u201ctopology.kubernetes.io/zone\u201d and specify the AZ where you'd like to create the worker nodes. For example, the below Karpenter provisioner snippet provisions the nodes in the us-west-2a AZ.</p> <p>Karpenter</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5\nkind: Provisioner\nmetadata:\nname: single-az\nspec:\n  requirements:\n  - key: \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone\u201c\n    operator: In\n    values: [\"us-west-2a\"]\n</code></pre> <p>Cluster Autoscaler (CA)</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5\nkind: ClusterConfig\nmetadata:\n  name: my-ca-cluster\n  region: us-east-1\n  version: \"1.21\"\navailabilityZones:\n- us-east-1a\nmanagedNodeGroups:\n- name: managed-nodes\n  labels:\n    role: managed-nodes\n  instanceType: t3.medium\n  minSize: 1\n  maxSize: 10\n  desiredCapacity: 1\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Using Pod Assignment and Node Affinity</p> <p>Alternatively, if you have worker nodes running in multiple AZs, each node would have the label topology.kubernetes.io/zone with the value of its AZ (such as us-west-2a or us-west-2b). You can utilize <code>nodeSelector</code> or <code>nodeAffinity</code> to schedule Pods to the nodes in a single AZ. For example, the following manifest file will schedule the Pod inside a node running in AZ us-west-2a.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\n  labels:\n    env: test\nspec:\n  nodeSelector:\n    topology.kubernetes.io/zone: us-west-2a\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx \n    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cost_optimization/cost_opt_networking/#restricting-traffic-to-a-node","title":"Restricting Traffic to a Node","text":"<p>There are cases where restricting traffic at a zonal level isn't sufficient. Apart from reducing costs, you may have the added requirement of reducing network latency between certain applications that have frequent inter-communication. In order to achieve optimal network performance and reduce costs, you need a way to restrict traffic to a specific node. For example, Microservice A should always talk to Microservice B on Node 1, even in highly available (HA) setups. Having Microservice A on Node 1 talk to Microservice B on Node 2 may have a negative impact on the desired performance for applications of this nature, especially if Node 2 is in a separate AZ altogether. </p> <p>Using the Service Internal Traffic Policy</p> <p>In order to restrict Pod network traffic to a node, you can make use of the Service internal traffic policy. By default, traffic sent to a workload's Service will be randomly distributed across the different generated endpoints. So in a HA architecture, that means traffic from Microservice A could go to any replica of Microservice B on any given node across the different AZs. However, with the Service's internal traffic policy set to <code>Local</code>, traffic will be restricted to endpoints on the node that the traffic originated from. This policy dictates the exclusive use of node-local endpoints. By implication, your network traffic-related costs for that workload will be lower than if the distribution was cluster wide. Also, the latency will be lower, making your application more performant. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>It's important to note that this feature cannot be combined with topology aware routing in Kubernetes.</p> <p></p> <p>Below is a code snippet on how to set the internal traffic policy for a Service. </p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: orders-service\n  namespace: ecommerce\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: orders\n  type: ClusterIP\n  ports:\n  - protocol: TCP\n    port: 3003\n    targetPort: 3003\n  internalTrafficPolicy: Local\n</code></pre> <p>To avoid unexpected behaviour from your application due to traffic drops, you should consider the following approaches:</p> <ul> <li>Run enough replicas for each of the communicating Pods</li> <li>Have a relatively even spread of Pods using topology spread constraints</li> <li>Make use of pod-affinity rules for co-location of communicating Pods</li> </ul> <p>In this example, you have 2 replicas of Microservice A and 3 replicas of Microservice B. If Microservice A has its replicas spread between Nodes 1 and 2, and Microservice B has all 3 of its replicas on Node 3, then they won't be able to communicate because of the <code>Local</code> internal traffic policy. When there are no available node-local endpoints the traffic is dropped. </p> <p></p> <p>If Microservice B does have 2 of its 3 replicas on Nodes 1 and 2, then there will be communication between the peer applications. But you would still have an isolated replica of Microservice B without any peer replica to communicate with. </p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>In some scenarios, an isolated replica like the one depicted in the above diagram may not be a cause for concern if it still serves a purpose (such as serving requests from external incoming traffic).</p> <p>Using the Service Internal Traffic Policy with Topology Spread Constraints</p> <p>Using the internal traffic policy in conjunction with topology spread constraints can be useful to ensure that you have the right number of replicas for communicating microservices on different nodes. </p> <pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: express-test\nspec:\n  replicas: 6\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: express-test\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: express-test\n        tier: backend\n    spec:\n      topologySpreadConstraints:\n      - maxSkew: 1\n        topologyKey: \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone\"\n        whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway\n        labelSelector:\n          matchLabels:\n            app: express-test\n</code></pre> <p>Using the Service Internal Traffic Policy with Pod Affinity Rules</p> <p>Another approach is to make use of Pod affinity rules when using the Service internal traffic policy.

This is done using Destination Rules such as locality weighted distribution. Using this feature, you can control the weight (expressed as a percentage) of traffic that can go to a certain destination based on its origin. The source of this traffic can either be from an external (or public facing) load balancer or a Pod within the cluster itself. When all the Pod endpoints are available, the locality will be selected based on a weighted round-robin load balancing algorithm. In the case that certain endpoints are unhealthy or unavailable, the locality weight will be automatically adjusted to reflect this change in the available endpoints. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>Before implementing locality weighted distribution, you should start by understanding your network traffic patterns and the implications that the Destination Rule policy may have on your application's behaviour. As such, it's important to have distributed tracing mechanisms in place with tools such as AWS X-Ray or Jaeger. </p> <p>The Istio Destination Rules detailed above can also be applied to manage traffic from a load balancer to Pods in your EKS cluster. Locality weighted distribution rules can be applied to a Service that receives traffic from a highly available load balancer (specifically the Ingress Gateway). These rules allow you to control how much traffic goes where based on its zonal origin - the load balancer in this case. If configured correctly, less egress cross-zone traffic will be incurred compared to a load balancer that distributes traffic evenly or randomly to Pod replicas in different AZs. </p> <p>Below is a code block example of a Destination Rule resource in Istio. As can be seen below, this resource specifies weighted configurations for incoming traffic from 3 different AZs in the <code>eu-west-1</code> region.

This can help provide a picture of the network flow as well as the share of distribution among the services of a workload. Continuing with the same example, the <code>orders</code> endpoints that the <code>graphql</code> proxy is aware of can be obtained using the following command:</p> <pre><code>kubectl exec -it deploy/graphql -n ecommerce -c istio-proxy -- curl localhost:15000/clusters | grep orders \n</code></pre> <pre><code>...\norders-service.ecommerce.svc.cluster.local::10.0.1.33:3003::**rq_error::0**\norders-service.ecommerce.svc.cluster.local::10.0.1.33:3003::**rq_success::119**\norders-service.ecommerce.svc.cluster.local::10.0.1.33:3003::**rq_timeout::0**\norders-service.ecommerce.svc.cluster.local::10.0.1.33:3003::**rq_total::119**\norders-service.ecommerce.svc.cluster.local::10.0.1.33:3003::**health_flags::healthy**\norders-service.ecommerce.svc.cluster.local::10.0.1.33:3003::**region::af-south-1**\norders-service.ecommerce.svc.cluster.local::10.0.1.33:3003::**zone::af-south-1b**\n...\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, the <code>graphql</code> proxy is only aware of the <code>orders</code> endpoint for the replica that it shares a node with. If you remove the <code>internalTrafficPolicy: Local</code> setting from the orders Service, and re-run a command like the one above, then the results will return all the endpoints of the replicas spread across the different nodes. Furthermore, by examining the <code>rq_total</code> for the respective endpoints, you'll notice a relatively even share in network distribution.

They cannot be detached and re-attached to other instances. You can learn more about Amazon EC2 instance stores here. There are no additional fees associated with an instance store volume. This makes them (instance store volumes) more cost efficient than the general EC2 instances with large EBS volumes. </p> <p>To use local store volumes in Kubernetes, you should partition, configure, and format the disks using the Amazon EC2 user-data so that volumes can be mounted as a HostPath in the pod spec.

This strategy instructs EC2 to provision instances from the deepest pools for the number of instances that you are launching and have the lowest risk of interruption.

By default, Karpenter will use all Instance Types EC2 offers in the region and availability zones your cluster is deployed in. Karpenter intelligently chooses from the set of all instance types based on pending pods to make sure your pods are scheduled onto appropriately sized and equipped instances. For example, if your pod does not require a GPU, Karpenter will not schedule your pod to an EC2 instance type supporting a GPU. When you're unsure about which instance types to use, you can run the Amazon ec2-instance-selector to generate a list of instance types that match your compute requirements.

When a limit is exceeded the Karpenter controller will write <code>memory resource usage of 1001 exceeds limit of 1000</code> or a similar looking message to the controller's logs.

EKS's support for IPv6 is focused on resolving the IPv4 exhaustion problem, which stems from the limited size of the IPv4 address space. This is a significant concern raised by a number of our customers and is distinct from Kubernetes' \u201cIPv4/IPv6 dual-stack\u201d feature. EKS/IPv6 will also provide the flexability to inter-connect network boundaries using IPv6 CIDRs hence minimizing the chances to suffer from CIDR overlap, therefor solving a 2-Fold problem (In-Cluster, Cross-Cluster). When deploying EKS clusters in IPv6 mode (--ip-family ipv6), the action is not a reversible. In simple words EKS IPv6 support is enabled for the entire lifetime of your cluster.</p> <p>In an IPv6 EKS cluster, Pods and Services will receive IPv6 addresses while maintaining compatibility with legacy IPv4 Endpoints. This includes the ability for external IPv4 endpoints to access in-cluster services, and Pods to access external IPv4 endpoints.</p> <p>Amazon EKS IPv6 support leverages the native VPC IPv6 capabilities. Each VPC is allocated with an IPv4 address prefix (CIDR block size can be from /16 to /28) and a unique /56 IPv6 address prefix (fixed) from within Amazon's GUA (Global Unicast Address); you can assign a /64 address prefix to each subnet in your VPC. IPv4 features, like Route Tables, Network Access Control Lists, Peering, and DNS resolution, work the same way in an IPv6 enabled VPC. The VPC is then referred as dual-stack VPC, following dual-stack subnets, the following diagram depict the IPV4&amp;IPv6 VPC foundation pattern that support EKS/IPv6 based clusters:</p> <p></p> <p>In the IPv6 world, every address is internet routable. By default, VPC allocates IPv6 CIDR from the public GUA range. VPCs do not support assigning private IPv6 addresses from the Unique Local Address (ULA) range as defined by RFC 4193 (fd00::/8 or fc00::/8). This is true even when you would like to assign an IPv6 CIDR owned by you. Egressing to the internet from Private Subnets is supported by implementing an egress-only internet gateway (EIGW) in a VPC, allowing outbound traffic while blocking all incoming traffic.  The following diagram depict a Pod IPv6 Internet egress flow inside an EKS/IPv6 cluster:</p> <p></p> <p>Best practices for implementing IPv6 subnets can be found in the VPC user guide.</p> <p>In an IPv6 EKS cluster, nodes and Pods receive public IPv6 addresses. EKS assigns IPv6 addresses to services based on Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULA). The ULA Service CIDR for an IPv6 cluster is automatically assigned during the cluster creation stage and cannot be specified, unlike IPv4.

This behaviour is known to mitigate scenarios where high Pod churn EKS/IPv4 clusters are often delayed in Pod scheduling due to throttled API calls generated by the VPC CNI plug-in (ipamd) aimed to allocate Private IPv4 addresses in a timely fashion. It is also known to make the VPC-CNI plug-in advanced knobs tuning WARM_IP/ENI, MINIMUM_IP unnecessarily.</p> <p>The following diagram zooms into an IPv6 worker-node Elastic Network Interface (ENI):</p> <p></p> <p>Every EKS worker-node is assigned with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, along with corresponding DNS entries. For a given worker-node, only a single IPv4 address from the dual-stack subnet is consumed. EKS support for IPv6 enables you to communicate with IPv4 endpoints (AWS, on-premise, internet) through a highly opinionated egress-only IPv4 model. EKS implements a host-local CNI plugin, secondary to the VPC CNI plugin, which allocates and configures an IPv4 address for a Pod. The CNI plugin configures a host-specific non-routable IPv4 address for a Pod from the 169.254.172.0/22 range. The IPv4 address assigned to the Pod is unique to the worker-node and is not advertised beyond the worker-node. 169.254.172.0/22 provides up to 1024 unique IPv4 addresses which can support large instance types.</p> <p>The following diagram depict the flow of an IPv6 Pod connecting to an IPv4 endpoint outside the cluster boundary (non-internet):</p> <p></p> <p>In the above diagram Pods will perform a DNS lookup for the endpoint and, upon receiving an IPv4 \u201cA\u201d response, Pod's node-only unique IPv4 address is translated through source network address translation (SNAT) to the Private IPv4 (VPC) address of the primary network interface attached to the EC2 Worker-node.</p> <p>EKS/IPv6 Pods will also need to connect to IPv4 endpoints over the internet using public IPv4 Addresses, to achieve that a similar flow exists.

The Pod IPv4 Address (Source IPv4: EC2 Primary IP) is then routed to the IPv4 NAT Gateway where the EC2 Primary IP is translated (SNAT) into a valid internet routable IPv4 Public IP Address (NAT Gateway Assigned Public IP).</p> <p>Any Pod-to-Pod communication across the nodes always uses an IPv6 address.

In such a state you would neither want to kill the application nor forward any requests to it. Readiness probe enables you to make sure that the Pod is not considered to be \u201cReady\u201d, meaning that it will not be added to the EndpointSlice object, until the probe result is <code>success</code>.

This does not have any impact on the requests between microservices themselves in the Kubernetes layer (east west traffic) since the EndpointSlice Controller keeps the list of endpoints (Pods) always up to date. Why and when would you need an external mechanism then ? </p> <p>When you expose your applications using Kubernetes Service type of Load Balancer or Kubernetes Ingress (for north - south traffic) then the list of Pod IPs for the respective Kubernetes Service must be propagated to the external infrastructure load balancer so that the load balancer also has an up to date list targets. AWS Load Balancer Controller bridges the gap here. When you use AWS Load Balancer Controller and leverage  <code>target group: IP</code> , just like <code>kube-proxy</code> the AWS Load Balancer Controller also receives an update (via <code>watch</code>) and then it communicates with the ELB API to configure and start registering the Pod IP as a target on the ELB. </p> <p>When you perform a rolling update of a Deployment, new Pods get created, and as soon as a new Pod's condition is \u201cReady\u201d an old/existing Pod gets terminated. During this process, the Kubernetes EndpointSlice object is updated faster than the time it takes the ELB to register the new Pods as targets, see target registration. For a brief time you could have a state mismatch between the Kubernetes layer and the infrastructure layer where client requests could be dropped. During this period within the Kubernetes layer new Pods would be ready to process requests but from ELB point of view they are not.</p> <p>Pod Readiness Gates enables you to define additional requirements that must be met before the Pod condition is considered to be \u201cReady\u201d. In the case of AWS ELB, the AWS Load Balancer Controller monitors the status of the target (the Pod) on the AWS ELB and once the target registration completes and its status turns \u201cHealthy\u201d then the controller updates the Pod' s condition to \u201cReady\u201d. With this approach you influence the Pod condition based on the state of the external network, which is the target status on the AWS ELB. Pod Readiness Gates is crucial in rolling update scenarios as it enables you to prevent the rolling update of a deployment from terminating old pods until the newly created Pods target status turn \u201cHealthy\u201d on the AWS ELB. </p>"},{"location":"networking/loadbalancing/loadbalancing/#gracefully-shutdown-applications","title":"Gracefully shutdown applications","text":"<p>Your application should respond to a SIGTERM signal by starting its graceful shutdown so that clients do not experience any downtime.

Carefully inspect the following diagram which shows the sequence of events.</p> <p></p> <p>The way the state propagates all the way from API server down to the iptables rules on the nodes explained above creates an interesting race condition. Because there is a high chance that the container receives the SIGKILL signal much earlier than the kube-proxy on each node updates the local iptables rules. In such an event two scenarios worth mentioning are : </p> <ul> <li>If your application immediately and bluntly drops the in-flight requests and connections upon receipt of SIGTERM which means the clients would see 50x errors all over the place.</li> <li>Even if your application ensures that all in-flight requests and connections are processed completely upon receipt of SIGTERM, during the grace period, new client requests would still be sent to the application container because iptables rules may still not be updated yet. Until the cleanup procedure closes the server socket on the container those new requests will result in new connections. When the grace period ends those connections, which are established after the SIGTERM, at that time are dropped unconditionally since SIGKILL is sent. </li> </ul> <p>Setting the grace period in Pod spec long enough may address this challenge but depending on the propagation delay and the number of actual client requests it is hard to anticipate the time it takes for the application to close out the connections gracefully. Hence the not so perfect but most feasible approach here is to use a PreStop hook to delay the SIGTERM signal until the iptables rules are updated to make sure that no new client requests are sent to the application rather, only existing connections carry on.  PreStop hook can be a simple Exec handler such as <code>sleep 10</code>. </p> <p>The behavior and the recommendation mentioned above would be equally applicable when you expose your applications using Kubernetes Service type of Load Balancer or Kubernetes Ingress (for north - south traffic) using AWS Load Balancer Controller and leverage  <code>target group: IP</code> . Because just like <code>kube-proxy</code> the AWS Load Balancer Controller also receives an update (via watch) on the EndpointSlice object and then it communicates with the ELB API to start deregistering the Pod IP from the ELB. However depending on the load on Kubernetes API or the ELB API this can also take time and the SIGTERM may have already been sent to the application long ago. Once the ELB starts deregistering the target it stops sending requests to that target so the application will not receive any new requests and the ELB also starts a Deregistration delay which is 300 seconds by default. During the deregistration process the target is <code>draining</code>  where basically the ELB waits for the in-flight requests/existing connections to that target to drain. Once the deregistration delay expires then the target is unused and any in-flight requests to that target is forcibly dropped. </p>"},{"location":"networking/loadbalancing/loadbalancing/#use-pod-disruption-budget","title":"Use Pod disruption budget","text":"<p>Configure a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) for your applications.

By default, the Amazon VPC CNI will use security groups associated with the primary ENI on the node. More specifically, every ENI associated with the instance will have the same EC2 Security Groups. Thus, every Pod on a node shares the same security groups as the node it runs on. </p> <p>As seen in the image below, all application Pods operating on worker nodes will have access to the RDS database service (considering RDS inbound allows node security group). Security groups are too coarse grained because they apply to all Pods running on a node. Security groups for Pods provides network segmentation for workloads which is an essential part a good defense in depth strategy.</p> <p> With security groups for Pods, you can improve compute efficiency by running applications with varying network security requirements on shared compute resources. Multiple types of security rules, such as Pod-to-Pod and Pod-to-External AWS services, can be defined in a single place with EC2 security groups and applied to workloads with Kubernetes native APIs. The image below shows security groups applied at the Pod level and how they simplify your application deployment and node architecture. The Pod can now access Amazon RDS database.</p> <p></p> <p>You can enable security groups for Pods by setting <code>ENABLE_POD_ENI=true</code> for VPC CNI. Once enabled, the \u201cVPC Resource Controller\u201c running on the control plane (managed by EKS) creates and attaches a trunk interface called \u201caws-k8s-trunk-eni\u201c to the node. The trunk interface acts as a standard network interface attached to the instance. To manage trunk interfaces, you must add the <code>AmazonEKSVPCResourceController</code> managed policy to the cluster role that goes with your Amazon EKS cluster.</p> <p>The controller also creates branch interfaces named \"aws-k8s-branch-eni\" and associates them with the trunk interface. Pods are assigned a security group using the SecurityGroupPolicy custom resource and are associated with a branch interface. Since security groups are specified with network interfaces, we are now able to schedule Pods requiring specific security groups on these additional network interfaces. Review the EKS User Guide Section on Security Groups for Pods, including deployment prerequisites.</p> <p></p> <p>Branch interface capacity is additive to existing instance type limits for secondary IP addresses. Pods that use security groups are not accounted for in the max-pods formula and when you use security group for pods you need to consider raising the max-pods value or be ok with running fewer pods than the node can actually support.</p> <p>A m5.large can have up to 9 branch network interfaces and up to 27 secondary IP addresses assigned to its standard network interfaces. As shown in the example below, the default max-pods for a m5.large is 29, and EKS counts the Pods that use security groups towards the maximum Pods. Please see the EKS user guide for instructions on how to change the max-pods for nodes.</p> <p>When security groups for Pods are used in combination with custom networking, the security group defined in security groups for Pods is used rather than the security group specified in the ENIConfig.

Amazon EKS supports IPv4 by default. A VPC must have an IPv4 CIDR block associated with it. You can optionally associate multiple IPv4 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks and multiple IPv6 CIDR blocks to your VPC. When you create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC from the private IPv4 address ranges as specified in RFC 1918. The allowed block size is between a <code>/16</code> prefix (65,536 IP addresses) and <code>/28</code> prefix (16 IP addresses). </p> <p>When creating a new VPC, you can attach a single IPv6 CIDR block, and up to five when changing an existing VPC. The prefix length of the IPv6 CIDR block size can be between /44 and /60 and for the IPv6 subnets it can be betwen /44/ and /64. You can request an IPv6 CIDR block from the pool of IPv6 addresses maintained by Amazon. Please refer to VPC CIDR blocks section of the VPC User Guide for more information.</p> <p>Amazon EKS clusters support both IPv4 and IPv6. By default, EKS clusters use IPv4 IP. Specifying IPv6 at cluster creation time will enable the use IPv6 clusters. IPv6 clusters require dual-stack VPCs and subnets.</p> <p>Amazon EKS recommends you use at least two subnets that are in different Availability Zones during cluster creation. The subnets you pass in during cluster creation are known as cluster subnets. When you create a cluster, Amazon EKS creates up to 4 cross account (x-account or x-ENIs) ENIs in the subnets that you specify. The x-ENIs are always deployed and are used for cluster administration traffic such as log delivery, exec, and proxy. Please refer to the EKS user guide for complete VPC and subnet requirement details. </p> <p>Kubernetes worker nodes can run in the cluster subnets, but it is not recommended. During cluster upgrades Amazon EKS provisions additional ENIs in the cluster subnets. When your cluster scales out, worker nodes and pods may consume the available IPs in the cluster subnet. Hence in order to make sure there are enough available IPs you might want to consider using dedicated cluster subnets with /28 netmask.</p> <p>Kubernetes worker nodes can run in either a public or a private subnet.

The CNI plugin allows Kubernetes Pods to have the same IP address as they do on the VPC network. More specifically, all containers inside the Pod share a network namespace, and they can communicate with each-other using local ports.</p> <p>Amazon VPC CNI has two components:</p> <ul> <li>CNI Binary, which will setup Pod network to enable Pod-to-Pod communication. The CNI binary runs on a node root file system and is invoked by the kubelet when a new Pod gets added to, or an existing Pod removed from the node.</li> <li>ipamd, a long-running node-local IP Address Management (IPAM) daemon and is responsible for:</li> <li>managing ENIs on a node, and</li> <li>maintaining a warm-pool of available IP addresses or prefix</li> </ul> <p>When an instance is created, EC2 creates and attaches a primary ENI associated with a primary subnet. The primary subnet may be public or private. The Pods that run in hostNetwork mode use the primary IP address assigned to the node primary ENI and share the same network namespace as the host.</p> <p>The CNI plugin manages Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) on the node. When a node is provisioned, the CNI plugin automatically allocates a pool of slots (IPs or Prefix's) from the node's subnet to the primary ENI. This pool is known as the warm pool, and its size is determined by the node's instance type. Depending on CNI settings, a slot may be an IP address or a prefix. When a slot on an ENI has been assigned, the CNI may attach additional ENIs with warm pool of slots to the nodes. These additional ENIs are called Secondary ENIs. Each ENI can only support a certain number of slots, based on instance type. The CNI attaches more ENIs to instances based on the number of slots needed, which usually corresponds to the number of Pods. This process continues until the node can no longer support additional ENI. The CNI also pre-allocates \u201cwarm\u201d ENIs and slots for faster Pod startup. Note each instance type has a maximum number of ENIs that may be attached. This is one constraint on Pod density (number of Pods per node), in addition to compute resources.</p> <p></p> <p>The maximum number of network interfaces, and the maximum number of slots that you can use varies by the type of EC2 Instance. Since each Pod consumes an IP address on a slot, the number of Pods you can run on a particular EC2 Instance depends on how many ENIs can be attached to it and how many slots each ENI supports. We suggest setting the maximum Pods per EKS user guide to avoid exhaustion of the instance's CPU and memory resources. Pods using <code>hostNetwork</code> are excluded from this calculation. You may consider using a script called max-pods-calculator.sh to calculate EKS's recommended maximum Pods for a given instance type.</p>"},{"location":"networking/vpc-cni/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Secondary IP mode is the default mode for VPC CNI. This guide provides a generic overview of VPC CNI behavior when Secondary IP mode is enabled. The functionality of ipamd (allocation of IP addresses) may vary depending on the configuration settings for VPC CNI, such as Prefix Mode, Security Groups Per Pod, and Custom Networking.</p> <p>The Amazon VPC CNI is deployed as a Kubernetes Daemonset named aws-node on worker nodes. When a worker node is provisioned, it has a default ENI, called the primary ENI, attached to it. The CNI allocates a warm pool of ENIs and secondary IP addresses from the subnet attached to the node's primary ENI. By default, ipamd attempts to allocate an additional ENI to the node. The IPAMD allocates additional ENI when a single Pod is scheduled and assigned a secondary IP address from the primary ENI. This \"warm\" ENI enables faster Pod networking. As the pool of secondary IP addresses runs out, the CNI adds another ENI to assign more.</p> <p>The number of ENIs and IP addresses in a pool are configured through environment variables called WARM_ENI_TARGET, WARM_IP_TARGET, MINIMUM_IP_TARGET. The <code>aws-node</code> Daemonset will periodically check that a sufficient number of ENIs are attached. A sufficient number of ENIs are attached when all of the <code>WARM_ENI_TARGET</code>, or <code>WARM_IP_TARGET</code> and <code>MINIMUM_IP_TARGET</code> conditions are met. If there are insufficient ENIs attached, the CNI will make an API call to EC2 to attach more until <code>MAX_ENI</code> limit is reached.</p> <ul> <li><code>WARM_ENI_TARGET</code> - Integer, Values &gt;0 indicate requirement Enabled</li> <li>The number of Warm ENIs to be maintained. An ENI is \u201cwarm\u201d when it is attached as a secondary ENI to a node, but it is not in use by any Pod. More specifically, no IP addresses of the ENI have been associated with a Pod.</li> <li>Example: Consider an instance with 2 ENIs, each ENI supporting 5 IP addresses. WARM_ENI_TARGET is set to 1. If exactly 5 IP addresses are associated with the instance, the CNI maintains 2 ENIs attached to the instance. The first ENI is in use, and all 5 possible IP addresses of this ENI are used. The second ENI is \u201cwarm\u201d with all 5 IP addresses in pool. If another Pod is launched on the instance, a 6th IP address will be needed. The CNI will assign this 6th Pod an IP address from the second ENI and from 5 IPs from the pool. The second ENI is now in use, and no longer in a \u201cwarm\u201d status. The CNI will allocate a 3rd ENI to maintain at least 1 warm ENI.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>The warm ENIs still consume IP addresses from the CIDR of your VPC. IP addresses are \u201cunused\u201d or \u201cwarm\u201d until they are associated with a workload, such as a Pod.</p> <ul> <li><code>WARM_IP_TARGET</code>, Integer, Values &gt;0 indicate requirement Enabled</li> <li>The number of Warm IP addresses to be maintained. A Warm IP is available on an actively attached ENI, but has not been assigned to a Pod. In other words, the number of Warm IPs available is the number of IPs that may be assigned to a Pod without requiring an additional ENI.</li> <li>Example: Consider an instance with 1 ENI, each ENI supporting 20 IP addresses. WARM_IP_TARGET is set to 5. WARM_ENI_TARGET is set to 0. Only 1 ENI will be attached until a 16th IP address is needed. Then, the CNI will attach a second ENI, consuming 20 possible addresses from the subnet CIDR.</li> <li><code>MINIMUM_IP_TARGET</code>, Integer, Values &gt;0 indicate requirement Enabled</li> <li>The minimum number of IP addresses to be allocated at any time. This is commonly used to front-load the assignment of multiple ENIs at instance launch.</li> <li>Example: Consider a newly launched instance. It has 1 ENI and each ENI supports 10 IP addresses. MINIMUM_IP_TARGET is set to 100. The ENI immediately attaches 9 more ENIs for a total of 100 addresses. This happens regardless of any WARM_IP_TARGET or WARM_ENI_TARGET values.</li> </ul> <p>This project includes a Subnet Calculator Excel Document. This calculator document simulates the IP address consumption of a specified workload under different ENI configuration options, such as <code>WARM_IP_TARGET</code> and <code>WARM_ENI_TARGET</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>When Kubelet receives an add Pod request, the CNI binary queries ipamd for an available IP address, which ipamd then provides to the Pod. The CNI binary wires up the host and Pod network.</p> <p>Pods deployed on a node are, by default, assigned to the same security groups as the primary ENI. Alternatively, Pods may be configured with different security groups.</p> <p></p> <p>As the pool of IP addresses is depleted, the plugin automatically attaches another elastic network interface to the instance and allocates another set of secondary IP addresses to that interface. This process continues until the node can no longer support additional elastic network interfaces.</p> <p></p> <p>When a Pod is deleted, VPC CNI places the Pod's IP address in a 30-second cool down cache. The IPs in a cool down cache are not assigned to new Pods. When the cooling-off period is over, VPC CNI moves Pod IP back to the warm pool. The cooling-off period prevents Pod IP addresses from being recycled prematurely and allows kube-proxy on all cluster nodes to finish updating the iptables rules. When the number of IPs or ENIs exceeds the number of warm pool settings, the ipamd plugin returns IPs and ENIs to the VPC.</p> <p>As described above in Secondary IP mode, each Pod receives one secondary private IP address from one of the ENIs attached to an instance. Since each Pod uses an IP address, the number of Pods you can run on a particular EC2 Instance depends on how many ENIs can be attached to it and how many IP addresses it supports. The VPC CNI checks the limits file to find out how many ENIs and IP addresses are allowed for each type of instance.</p> <p>You can use the following formula to determine maximum number of Pods you can deploy on a node.</p> <p><code>(Number of network interfaces for the instance type \u00d7 (the number of IP addresses per network interface - 1)) + 2</code></p> <p>The +2 indicates Kubernetes Pods that use host networking, such as kube-proxy and VPC CNI. Amazon EKS requires kube-proxy and VPC CNI to be running on every node and are calculated towards max-pods. Consider updating max-pods if you plan to run more host networking Pods. You can specify <code>--kubelet-extra-args \"\u2014max-pods=110\"</code> as user data in the launch template.</p> <p>As an example, on a cluster with 3 c5.large nodes (3 ENIs and max 10 IPs per ENI), when the cluster starts up and has 2 CoreDNS pods, the CNI will consume 49 IP addresses and keeps them in warm pool. The warm pool enables faster Pod launches when the application is deployed.</p> <p>Node 1 (with CoreDNS pod): 2 ENIs, 20 IPs assigned</p> <p>Node 2 (with CoreDNS pod): 2 ENIs, 20 IPs assigned</p> <p>Node 3 (no Pod): 1 ENI. 10 IPs assigned.</p> <p>Keep in mind that infrastructure pods, often running as daemon sets, each contribute to the max-pod count. These can include:</p> <ul> <li>CoreDNS</li> <li>Amazon Elastic LoadBalancer</li> <li>Operational pods for metrics-server</li> </ul> <p>We suggest that you plan your infrastructure by combining these Pods' capacities. For a list of the maximum number of Pods supported by each instance type, see eni-max-Pods.txt on GitHub.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"networking/vpc-cni/#recommendations","title":"Recommendations","text":""},{"location":"networking/vpc-cni/#deploy-vpc-cni-managed-add-on","title":"Deploy VPC CNI Managed Add-On","text":"<p>When you provision a cluster, Amazon EKS installs VPC CNI automatically.

The following best practices will help you to achieve that.</p>"},{"location":"performance/performance_WIP/#recommendations","title":"Recommendations","text":"<ul> <li>Make your container images stateless: A container created with a Docker image should be ephemeral and immutable. In other words, the container should be disposable and independent, i.e. a new one can be built and put in place with absolutely no configuration changes. Design your containers to be stateless. If you would like to use persistent data, use volumes instead. If you would like to store secrets or sensitive application data used by services, you can use solutions like AWS Systems ManagerParameter Store or third-party offerings or open source solutions, such as HashiCorp Valut and Consul, for runtime configurations.</li> <li>Minimal base image : Start with a small base image. Every other instruction in the Dockerfile builds on top of this image. The smaller the base image, the smaller the resulting image is, and the more quickly it can be downloaded. For example, the alpine:3.7 image is 71 MB smaller than the centos:7 image. You can even use the scratch base image, which is an empty image on which you can build your own runtime environment.</li> <li>Avoid unnecessary packages: When building a container image, include only the dependencies what your application needs and avoid installing unnecessary packages. For example if your application does not need an SSH server, don't include one.  This will reduce complexity, dependencies, file sizes, and build times.  To exclude files not relevant to the build use a .dockerignore file.</li> <li>Use multi-stage build:Multi-stage builds allow you to build your application in a first \"build\" container and use the result in another container, while using the same Dockerfile.  To expand a bit on that, in multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't want in the final image.  This method drastically reduces the size of your final image, without struggling to reduce the number of intermediate layers and files.</li> <li>Minimize number of layers: Each instruction in the Dockerfile adds an extra layer to the Docker image. The number of instructions and layers should be kept to a minimum as this affects build performance and time. For example, the first  instruction below will create multiple layers, whereas the second instruction by using &amp;&amp;(chaining) we reduced the number of layers, which will help provide better performance. The is the best way to reduce the number of layers that will be created in your Dockerfile.</li> <li> <pre><code>        RUN apt-get -y update\n        RUN apt-get install -y python\n        RUN apt-get -y update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Properly tag your images: When building images, always tag them with useful and meaningful tags. This is a good way to organize and document metadata describing an image, for example, by including a unique counter like build id from a CI server (e.g. CodeBuild or Jenkins) to help with identifying the correct image. The tag latest is used by default if you do not provide one in your Docker commands.  We recommend not to use the automatically created latest tag, because by using this tag you'll automatically be running future major releases, which could include breaking changes for your application. The best practice is to avoid the latest tag and instead use the unique digest created by your CI server.</p> </li> <li>Use Build Cache to improve build speed : The cache allows you to take advantage of existing cached images, rather than building each image from scratch. For example, you should add the source code of your application as late as possible in your Dockerfile so that the base image and your application's dependencies get cached and aren't rebuilt on every build. To reuse already cached images, By default in Amazon EKS, the kubelet will try to pull each image from the specified registry. However, if the imagePullPolicy property of the container is set to IfNotPresent or Never, then a local image is used (preferentially or exclusively, respectively).</li> <li> <p>Image Security : Using public images  may be  a great way to start working on containers and deploying it to Kubernetes. However, using them in production can come with a set of challenges. Especially when it comes to security. Ensure to follow the best practices for packaging and distributing the containers/applications. For example, don't build your containers with passwords baked in also you might need to control what's inside them.  Recommend to use private repository such as Amazon ECR and leverage the in-built image scanning feature to identify software vulnerabilities in your container images.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Right size your containers:  As you develop and run applications in containers, there are a few key areas to consider. How you size containers and manage your application deployments can negatively impact the end-user experience of services that you provide. To help you succeed, the following best practices will help you right size your containers.

For example, a three tier LAMP application container. Should we keep this application in the same pod? Well, this works effectively as a single pod but this is an example of an anti-pattern for Pod creation. There are two reasons for that </p> <p>(a) If you have both the containers in the same Pod, you are forced to use the same scaling strategy which is not ideal for production environment also you can't effectively manage or constraint resources based on the usage. E.g: you might need to scale just the frontend not frontend and backend (MySQL) as a unit also if you would like to increase the resources dedicated just to the backend, you cant just do that.</p> <p>(b) If you have two separate pods, one for frontend and other for backend. Scaling would be very easy and you get a better reliability.</p> <p>The above might not work in all the use-cases. In the above example frontend and backend may land in different machines and they will communicate with each other via network, So you need to ask the question \"Will my application work correctly, If they are placed and run on different machines?\" If the answer is a \"no\" may be because of the application design or for some other technical reasons, then grouping of containers in a single pod makes sense. If the answer is \"Yes\" then multiple Pods is the correct approach.</p>"},{"location":"performance/performance_WIP/#recommendations_1","title":"Recommendations","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Package a single application per container: A container works best when a single application runs inside it. This application should have a single parent process. For example, do not run PHP and MySQL in the same container: it's harder to debug, and you can't horizontally scale the PHP container alone. This separation allows you to better tie the lifecycle of the application to that of the container.  Your containers should be both stateless and immutable. Stateless means that any state (persistent data of any kind) is stored outside of the container, for example, you can use different kinds of external storage like Persistent disk, Amazon EBS, and Amazon EFS if needed, or managed database like Amazon RDS.  Immutable means that a container will not be modified during its life: no updates, no patches, and no configuration changes. To update the application code or apply a patch, you build a new image and deploy it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Labels to Kubernetes Objects: Labels allow Kubernetes objects to be queried and operated upon in bulk. They can also be used to identify and organize Kubernetes objects into groups. As such defining labels should figure right at the top of any Kubernetes best practices list.</p> </li> <li> <p>Setting resource request limits: Setting request limits is the mechanism used to control the amount of system resources that a container can consume such as CPU and memory. These settings are what the container is guaranteed to get when the container initially starts. If a container requests a resource, container orchestrators such as Kubernetes will only schedule it on a node that can provide that resource. Limits, on the other hand, make sure that a container never goes above a certain value. The container is only allowed to go up to the limit, and then it is restricted.</p> </li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the below example Pod manifest, we add a limit of 1.0 CPU and 256 MB of memory</p> <pre><code>        apiVersion: v1\n        kind: Pod\n        metadata:\n          name: nginx-pod-webserver\n          labels:\n            name: nginx-pod\n        spec:\n          containers:\n          - name: nginx\n            image: nginx:latest\n            resources:\n              limits:\n                memory: \"256Mi\"\n                cpu: \"1000m\"\n              requests:\n                memory: \"128Mi\"\n                cpu: \"500m\"\n            ports:\n            - containerPort: 80\n</code></pre> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's a best practice to define these requests and limits in your pod definitions. If you don't \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0include these values, the scheduler doesn't understand what resources are needed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without this information, the scheduler might schedule the pod on a node without \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sufficient resources to provide acceptable application performance.</p> <ul> <li>Limit the number of concurrent disruptions: Use  PodDisruptionBudget, This settings allows you to set a policy on the minimum available and maximum unavailable pods during voluntary eviction events.

A namespace allows to partition created resources into a logically named group. This allows you to set resource quotas per namespace, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) per namespace, and also network policies per namespace.

Specifying quota allows to restrict how much of cluster resources can be consumed across all resources in a namespace. Resource quota can be defined by a ResourceQuota object. A presence of ResourceQuota object in a namespace ensures that resource quotas are enforced.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure Health Checks for Pods: Health checks are a simple way to let the system know if an instance of your app is working or not. If an instance of your app is not working, then other services should not access it or send requests to it. Instead, requests should be sent to another instance of the app that is working. The system also should bring your app back to a healthy state.  By default, all the running pods have the restart policy set to always which means the kubelet running within a node will automatically restart a pod when the container encounters an error. Health checks extend this capability of kubelet through the concept of container probes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Kubernetes provides two types of health checks: readiness and liveness probes.  For example, consider if one of your applications, which typically runs for long periods of time, transitions to a non-running state and can only recover by being restarted. You can use liveness probes to detect and remedy such situations. Using health checks gives your applications better reliability, and higher uptime.</p> <ul> <li>Advanced Scheduling Techniques: Generally, schedulers ensure that pods are placed only on nodes that have sufficient free resources, and across nodes, they try to balance out the resource utilization across nodes, deployments, replicas, and so on. But sometimes you want to control how your pods are scheduled. For example, perhaps you want to ensure that certain pods are only scheduled on nodes with specialized hardware, such as requiring a GPU machine for an ML workload. Or you want to collocate services that communicate frequently.</li> </ul> <p>Kubernetes offers manyadvanced scheduling featuresand multiple filters/constraints to schedule the pods on the right node.  For example, when using Amazon EKS, you can usetaints and tolerationsto restrict what workloads can run on specific nodes. You can also control pod scheduling using node selectorsandaffinity and anti-affinityconstructs and even have your own custom scheduler built for this purpose.</p>"},{"location":"performance/performance_WIP/#scalability-management","title":"Scalability Management","text":"<p>Containers are stateless.

If a system can function consistently and meet demands in spite of changes in its environment over a period of time, it can be called reliable. To achieve this, the system has to detect failures, automatically heal itself, and have the ability to scale based on demand. </p> <p>Customers can use Kubernetes as a foundation to operate mission-critical applications and services reliably. But aside from incorporating container-based application design principles, running workloads reliably also requires a reliable infrastructure. In Kubernetes, infrastructure comprises the control plane and data plane. </p> <p>EKS provides a production-grade Kubernetes control plane that is designed to be highly-available and fault-tolerant. </p> <p>In EKS, AWS is responsible for the reliability of the Kubernetes control plane. EKS runs Kubernetes control plane across three availability zones in an AWS Region. It automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes API servers and the etcd cluster. </p> <p>The responsibility for the data plane's reliability is shared between you, the customer, and AWS. EKS offers three worker node options for deploying the Kubernetes data plane. Fargate, which is the most managed option, handles provisioning and scaling of the data plane. The second option, managed nodes groups, handles provisioning, and updates of the data plane. And finally, self-managed nodes is the least managed option for the data plane. The more AWS-managed data plane you use, the less responsibility you have.</p> <p>Managed node groups automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of EC2 nodes. You can use the EKS API (using EKS console, AWS API, AWS CLI, CloudFormation, Terraform, or <code>eksctl</code>),   to create, scale, and upgrade managed nodes. Managed nodes run EKS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instances in your account, and you can install custom software packages by enabling SSH access. When you provision managed nodes, they run as part of an EKS-managed Auto Scaling Group that can span multiple Availability Zones; you control this through the subnets you provide when creating managed nodes. EKS also automatically tags managed nodes so they can be used with Cluster Autoscaler. </p> <p>Amazon EKS follows the shared responsibility model for CVEs and security patches on managed node groups. Because managed nodes run the Amazon EKS-optimized AMIs, Amazon EKS is responsible for building patched versions of these AMIs when bug fixes. However, you are responsible for deploying these patched AMI versions to your managed node groups. </p> <p>EKS also manages updating the nodes although you have to initiate the update process. The process of updating managed node is explained in the EKS documentation. </p> <p>If you run self-managed nodes, you can use Amazon EKS-optimized Linux AMI to create worker nodes. You are responsible for patching and upgrading the AMI and the nodes. It is a best practice to use <code>eksctl</code>, CloudFormation, or infrastructure as code tools to provision self-managed nodes because this will make it easy for you to upgrade self-managed nodes. Consider migrating to new nodes when updating worker nodes because the migration process taints the old node group as <code>NoSchedule</code> and drains the nodes after a new stack is ready to accept the existing pod workload. However, you can also perform an in-place upgrade of self-managed nodes.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This guide includes a set of recommendations that you can use to improve the reliability of your EKS data plane, Kubernetes core components, and your applications.</p>"},{"location":"reliability/docs/#feedback","title":"Feedback","text":"<p>This guide is being released on GitHub to collect direct feedback and suggestions from the broader EKS/Kubernetes community.

Pod anti-affinity rules, on the other hand, can easily produce a result where you have a single replica in a topology domain because the pods with an anti-affinity toward each other have a repelling effect. In such cases, a single replica on a dedicated node isn't ideal for fault tolerance nor is it a good use of resources. With topology spread constraints, you have more control over the spread or distribution that the scheduler should try to apply across the topology domains. Here are some important properties to use in this approach: 1. The <code>maxSkew</code> is used to control or determine the maximum point to which things can be uneven across the topology domains. For example, if an application has 10 replicas and is deployed across 3 AZs, you can't get an even spread, but you can influence how uneven the distribution will be. In this case, the <code>maxSkew</code> can be anything between 1 and 10. A value of 1 means you can potentially end up with a spread like <code>4,3,3</code>, <code>3,4,3</code> or <code>3,3,4</code> across the 3 AZs. In contrast, a value of 10 means you can potentially end up with a spread like <code>10,0,0</code>, <code>0,10,0</code> or <code>0,0,10</code> across 3 AZs. 2. The <code>topologyKey</code> is a key for one of the node labels and defines the type of topology domain that should be used for the pod distribution. For example, a zonal spread would have the following key-value pair: <pre><code>topologyKey: \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone\"\n</code></pre> 3. The <code>whenUnsatisfiable</code> property is used to determine how you want the scheduler to respond if the desired constraints can't be satisfied. 4. The <code>labelSelector</code> is used to find matching pods so that the scheduler can be aware of them when deciding where to place pods in accordance with the constraints that you specify.</p> <p>In addition to these above, there are other fields that you can read about further in the Kubernetes documentation.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: spread-host-az\n  labels:\n    app: web-server\nspec:\n  replicas: 10\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: web-server\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: web-server\n    spec:\n      topologySpreadConstraints:\n      - maxSkew: 1\n        topologyKey: \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone\"\n        whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway\n        labelSelector:\n          matchLabels:\n            app: express-test\n      containers:\n      - name: web-app\n        image: nginx:1.16-alpine\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reliability/docs/application/#run-kubernetes-metrics-server","title":"Run Kubernetes Metrics Server","text":"<p>Install the Kubernetes metrics server to help scale your applications.

Depending on your upgrade strategy, Kubernetes cluster upgrades may require you to create new worker nodes, which requires all Pods to be recreated on newer nodes. Proper termination handling and Pod Disruption Budgets can help you avoid service disruptions as Pods are removed from older nodes and recreated on newer nodes.  </p> <p>The preferred way to upgrade worker nodes is by creating new worker nodes and terminating old ones. Before terminating worker nodes, you should <code>drain</code> it. When a worker node is drained, all its pods are safely evicted. Safely is a key word here; when pods on a worker are evicted, they are not simply sent a <code>SIGKILL</code> signal. Instead, a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal is sent to the main process (PID 1) of each container in the Pods being evicted. After the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal is sent, Kubernetes will give the process some time (grace period) before a <code>SIGKILL</code> signal is sent. This grace period is 30 seconds by default; you can override the default by using <code>grace-period</code> flag in kubectl or declare <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code> in your Podspec.</p> <p><code>kubectl delete pod &lt;pod name&gt; \u2014grace-period=&lt;seconds&gt;</code></p> <p>It is common to have containers in which the main process doesn't have PID 1.

When the Pod is terminated, the Python application will be killed abruptly. This can be remediated by changing the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> of the container to launch the Python application. Alternatively, you can use a tool like dumb-init to ensure that your application can handle signals.  </p> <p>You can also use Container hooks to execute a script or an HTTP request at container start or stop. The <code>PreStop</code> hook action runs before the container receives a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal and must complete before this signal is sent.

Once this limit is exceeded, the API Server will start rejecting requests and return a 429 HTTP response code for \"Too Many Requests\" back to clients. The server dropping requests and having clients try again later is preferable to having no server-side limits on the number of requests and overloading the control plane, which could result in degraded performance or unavailability.</p> <p>The mechanism used by Kubernetes to configure how these inflights requests are divided among different request types is called API Priority and Fairness. The API Server configures the total number of inflight requests it can accept by summing together the values specified by the <code>--max-requests-inflight</code> and <code>--max-mutating-requests-inflight</code> flags. EKS uses the default values of 400 and 200 requests for these flags, allowing a total of 600 requests to be dispatched at a given time. However, as it scales the control-plane to larger sizes in response to increased utilization and workload churn, it correspondingly increases the inflight request quota all the way till 2000 (subject to change). APF specifies how these inflight request quota is further sub-divided among different request types. Note that EKS control planes are highly available with at least 2 API Servers registered to each cluster. This means the total number of inflight requests your cluster can handle is twice (or higher if horizontally scaled out further) the inflight quota set per kube-apiserver. This amounts to several thousands of requests/second on the largest EKS clusters.</p> <p>Two kinds of Kubernetes objects, called PriorityLevelConfigurations and FlowSchemas, configure how the total number of requests is divided between different request types. These objects are maintained by the API Server automatically and EKS uses the default configuration of these objects for the given Kubernetes minor version. PriorityLevelConfigurations represent a fraction of the total number of allowed requests. For example, the workload-high PriorityLevelConfiguration is allocated 98 out of the total of 600 requests. The sum of requests allocated to all PriorityLevelConfigurations will equal 600 (or slightly above 600 because the API Server will round up if a given level is granted a fraction of a request). To check the PriorityLevelConfigurations in your cluster and the number of requests allocated to each, you can run the following command. These are the defaults on EKS 1.24:</p> <pre><code>$ kubectl get --raw /metrics | grep apiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit\napiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit{priority_level=\"catch-all\"} 13\napiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit{priority_level=\"global-default\"} 49\napiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit{priority_level=\"leader-election\"} 25\napiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit{priority_level=\"node-high\"} 98\napiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit{priority_level=\"system\"} 74\napiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit{priority_level=\"workload-high\"} 98\napiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit{priority_level=\"workload-low\"} 245\n</code></pre> <p>The second type of object are FlowSchemas. API Server requests with a given set of properties are classified under the same FlowSchema. These properties include either the authenticated user or attributes of the request, such as the API group, namespace, or resource. A FlowSchema also specifies which PriorityLevelConfiguration this type of request should map to. The two objects together say, \"I want this type of request to count towards this share of inflight requests.\" When a request hits the API Server, it will check each of its FlowSchemas until it finds one that matches all the required properties. If multiple FlowSchemas match a request, the API Server will choose the FlowSchema with the smallest matching precedence which is specified as a property in the object.</p> <p>The mapping of FlowSchemas to PriorityLevelConfigurations can be viewed using this command:</p> <pre><code>$ kubectl get flowschemas\nNAME                           PRIORITYLEVEL     MATCHINGPRECEDENCE   DISTINGUISHERMETHOD   AGE     MISSINGPL\nexempt                         exempt            1                    &lt;none&gt;                7h19m   False\neks-exempt                     exempt            2                    &lt;none&gt;                7h19m   False\nprobes                         exempt            2                    &lt;none&gt;                7h19m   False\nsystem-leader-election         leader-election   100                  ByUser                7h19m   False\nendpoint-controller            workload-high     150                  ByUser                7h19m   False\nworkload-leader-election       leader-election   200                  ByUser                7h19m   False\nsystem-node-high               node-high         400                  ByUser                7h19m   False\nsystem-nodes                   system            500                  ByUser                7h19m   False\nkube-controller-manager        workload-high     800                  ByNamespace           7h19m   False\nkube-scheduler                 workload-high     800                  ByNamespace           7h19m   False\nkube-system-service-accounts   workload-high     900                  ByNamespace           7h19m   False\neks-workload-high              workload-high     1000                 ByUser                7h14m   False\nservice-accounts               workload-low      9000                 ByUser                7h19m   False\nglobal-default                 global-default    9900                 ByUser                7h19m   False\ncatch-all                      catch-all         10000                ByUser                7h19m   False\n</code></pre> <p>PriorityLevelConfigurations can have a type of Queue, Reject, or Exempt. For types Queue and Reject, a limit is enforced on the maximum number of inflight requests for that priority level, however, the behavior differs when that limit is reached. For example, the workload-high PriorityLevelConfiguration uses type Queue and has 98 requests available for use by the controller-manager, endpoint-controller, scheduler,eks related controllers and from pods running in the kube-system namespace. Since type Queue is used, the API Server will attempt to keep requests in memory and hope that the number of inflight requests drops below 98 before these requests time out. If a given request times out in the queue or if too many requests are already queued, the API Server has no choice but to drop the request and return the client a 429. Note that queuing may prevent a request from receiving a 429, but it comes with the tradeoff of increased end-to-end latency on the request.</p> <p>Now consider the catch-all FlowSchema that maps to the catch-all PriorityLevelConfiguration with type Reject. If clients reach the limit of 13 inflight requests, the API Server will not exercise queuing and will drop the requests instantly with a 429 response code. Finally, requests mapping to a PriorityLevelConfiguration with type Exempt will never receive a 429 and always be dispatched immediately. This is used for high-priority requests such as healthz requests or requests coming from the system:masters group.  </p>"},{"location":"scalability/docs/control-plane/#monitoring-apf-and-dropped-requests","title":"Monitoring APF and Dropped Requests","text":"<p>To confirm if any requests are being dropped due to APF, the API Server metrics for <code>apiserver_flowcontrol_rejected_requests_total</code> can be monitored to check the impacted FlowSchemas and PriorityLevelConfigurations.

Since the system now works off a series of queues, we must look to see if any of these queues are full and if the traffic for that queue is getting dropped. </p> <p>Let's look at these queues with the following query:</p> <pre><code>max without(instance)(apiserver_flowcontrol_request_concurrency_limit{})\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>For more information on how API A&amp;F works please see the following best practices guide</p> <p>Here we see the seven different priority groups that come by default on the cluster</p> <p></p> <p>Next we want to see what percentage of that priority group is being used, so that we can understand if a certain priority level is being saturated.

A common issue we see in the field is increasing the queue depth to the point it starts adding unnecessary latency. We can monitor this problem by using the <code>apiserver_flowcontrol_current_inqueue_request</code> metric. We can check for drops using the <code>apiserver_flowcontrol_rejected_requests_total</code>. These metrics will be a non-zero value if any bucket exceeds its concurrency. </p> <p></p> <p>Increasing the queue depth can make the API Server a significant source of latency and should be done with care. We recommend being judicious with the number of queues created. For example, the number of shares on a EKS system is 600, if we create too many queues, this can reduce the shares in important queues that need the throughput such as the leader-election queue or system queue. Creating too many extra queues can make it more difficult to size theses queues correctly. </p> <p>To focus on a simple impactful change you can make in APF we simply take shares from underutilized buckets and increase the size of buckets that are at their max usage.

In this case we would be better served by using custom or external metric that accurately reflects the saturation of our application vs. the utilization. HPAv2 allows for this by having the ability to scale according to any metric, however we still need to find and export that metric to Kubernetes for use.</p> <p>For example, we can look at the active thread queue count in Apache. This often creates a \u201csmoother\u201d scaling profile (more on that term soon). If a thread is active, it doesn't matter if that thread is waiting on a database layer or servicing a request locally, if all of the applications threads are being used, it's a great indication that application is saturated. </p> <p>We can use this thread exhaustion as a signal to create a new pod with a fully available thread pool. This also gives us control over how big a buffer we want in the application to absorb during times of heavy traffic. For example, if we had a total thread pool of 10, scaling at 4 threads used vs. 8 threads used would have a major impact on the buffer we have available when scaling the application. A setting of 4 would make sense for an application that needs to rapidly scale under heavy load, where a setting of 8 would be more efficient with our resources if we had plenty of time to scale due to the number of requests increasing slowly vs. sharply over time. </p> <p></p> <p>What do we mean by the term \u201csmooth\u201d when it comes to scaling? Notice the below chart where we are using CPU as a metric. The pods in this deployment are spiking in a short period for from 50 pods, all the way up to 250 pods only to immediately scale down again. This is highly inefficient scaling is the leading cause on churn on clusters.</p> <p></p> <p>Notice how after we change to a metric that reflects the correct sweet spot of our application (mid-part of chart), we are able to scale smoothly. Our scaling is now efficient, and our pods are allowed to fully scale with the headroom we provided by adjusting requests settings. Now a smaller group of pods are doing the work the hundreds of pods were doing before.  Real world data shows that this is the number one factor in scalability of Kubernetes clusters. </p> <p></p> <p>The key takeaway is CPU utilization is only one dimension of both application and node performance. Using CPU utilization as a sole health indicator for our nodes and applications creates problems in scaling, performance and cost which are all tightly linked concepts. The more performant the application and nodes are, the less that you need to scale, which in turn lowers your costs. </p> <p>Finding and using the correct saturation metrics for scaling your particular application also allows you to monitor and alarm on the true bottlenecks for that application.

In short, limits are metadata associated with the container that has a counter that resets every 100ms. This helps Linux keep track of how many CPU resources are used node-wide by a specific container in a 100ms period of time. </p> <p></p> <p>A common error with setting limits is assuming that the application is single threaded and only running on it's \u201cassigned\u201c vCPU. In the above section we learned that CFS doesn't assign cores, and in reality a container running large thread pools will schedule on all available vCPU's on the box. </p> <p>If 64 OS threads are running across 64 available cores (from a Linux node perspective) we will make the total bill of used CPU time in a 100ms period quite large after the time running on all of those 64 cores are added up. Since this might only occur during a garbage collection process it can be quite easy to miss something like this. This is why it is necessary to use metrics to ensure we have the correct usage over time before attempting to set a limit. </p> <p>Fortunately, we have a way to see exactly how much vCPU is being used by all the threads in a application. We will use the metric <code>container_cpu_usage_seconds_total</code> for this purpose. </p> <p>Since throttling logic happens every 100ms and this metric is a per second metric, we will PromQL to match this 100ms period.

This is a more nuanced topic as there have been major changes in the way that CGroup v2 handles memory in Linux and Kubernetes has changed its syntax to reflect this; read this blog for further details.</p> <p>Unlike CPU requests, memory requests go unused after the scheduling process completes. This is because we can not compress memory in CGroup v1 the same way we can with CPU. That leaves us with just memory limits, which are designed to act as a fail safe for memory leaks by terminating the pod completely. This is an all or nothing style proposition, however we have now been given new ways to address this problem.</p> <p>First, it is important to understand that setting the right amount of memory for containers is not a straightforward as it appears. The file system in Linux will use memory as a cache to improve performance. This cache will grow over time, and it can be hard to know how much memory is just nice to have for the cache but can be reclaimed without a significant impact to application performance. This often results in misinterpreting memory usage.</p> <p>Having the ability to \u201ccompress\u201d memory was one of the primary drivers behind CGroup v2. For more history on why CGroup V2 was necessary, please see Chris Down's presentation at LISA21 where he covers why being unable to set the minimum memory correctly was one of the reasons that drove him to create CGroup v2  and pressure stall metrics. </p> <p>Fortunately, Kubernetes now has the concept of <code>memory.min</code> and <code>memory.high</code> under <code>requests.memory</code>. This gives us the option of aggressive releasing this cached memory for other containers to use. Once the container hits the memory high limit, the kernel can aggressively reclaim that container's memory up to the value set at <code>memory.min</code>. Thus giving us more flexibility when a node comes under memory pressure.</p> <p>The key question becomes, what value to set <code>memory.min</code> to? This is where memory pressure stall metrics come into play. We can use these metrics to detect memory \u201cthrashing\u201d at a container level. Then we can use controllers such as fbtax to detect the correct values for <code>memory.min</code> by looking for this memory thrashing, and dynamically set the <code>memory.min</code> value to this setting. </p>"},{"location":"scalability/docs/node_efficiency/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>To sum up the section, it is easy to conflate the following concepts: </p> <ul> <li>Utilization and Saturation  </li> <li>Linux performance rules with Kubernetes Scheduler logic</li> </ul> <p>Great care must be taken to keep these concepts separated.

SELinux allows administrators to enforce mandatory access controls (MAC) for every user, application, process, and file.  Think of it as a backstop that restricts the operations that can be performed against to specific resources based on a set of labels.  On EKS, SELinux can be used to prevent containers from accessing each other's resources.</p> <p>Container SELinux policies are defined in the container-selinux package.  Docker CE requires this package (along with its dependencies) so that the processes and files created by Docker (or other container runtimes) run with limited system access. Containers leverage the <code>container_t</code> label which is an alias to <code>svirt_lxc_net_t</code>. These policies effectively prevent containers from accessing certain features of the host.</p> <p>When you configure SELinux for Docker, Docker automatically labels workloads <code>container_t</code> as a type and gives each container a unique MCS level. This will isolate containers from one another. If you need looser restrictions, you can create your own profile in SElinux which grants a container permissions to specific areas of the file system.  This is similar to PSPs in that you can create different profiles for different containers/pods.  For example, you can have a profile for general workloads with a set of restrictive controls and another for things that require privileged access.</p> <p>SELinux for Containers has a set of options that can be configured to modify the default restrictions. The following SELinux Booleans can be enabled or disabled based on your needs:</p> Boolean Default Description <code>container_connect_any</code> <code>off</code> Allow containers to access privileged ports on the host. For example, if you have a container that needs to map ports to 443 or 80 on the host. <code>container_manage_cgroup</code> <code>off</code> Allow containers to manage cgroup configuration. For example, a container running systemd will need this to be enabled. <code>container_use_cephfs</code> <code>off</code> Allow containers to use a ceph file system. <p>By default, containers are allowed to read/execute under <code>/usr</code> and read most content from <code>/etc</code>. The files under <code>/var/lib/docker</code> and <code>/var/lib/containers</code> have the label <code>container_var_lib_t</code>. To view a full list of default, labels see the container.fc file.</p> <pre><code>docker container run -it \\\n  -v /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/repositories.json:/host/repositories.json \\\n  centos:7 cat /host/repositories.json\n# cat: /host/repositories.json: Permission denied\n\ndocker container run -it \\\n  -v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd \\\n  centos:7 cat /host/etc/passwd\n# cat: /host/etc/passwd: Permission denied\n</code></pre> <p>Files labeled with <code>container_file_t</code> are the only files that are writable by containers. If you want a volume mount to be writeable, you will needed to specify <code>:z</code> or <code>:Z</code> at the end.</p> <ul> <li><code>:z</code> will re-label the files so that the container can read/write</li> <li><code>:Z</code> will re-label the files so that only the container can read/write</li> </ul> <pre><code>ls -Z /var/lib/misc\n# -rw-r--r--. root root system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0   postfix.aliasesdb-stamp\n\ndocker container run -it \\\n  -v /var/lib/misc:/host/var/lib/misc:z \\\n  centos:7 echo \"Relabeled!\"\n\nls -Z /var/lib/misc\n#-rw-r--r--. root root system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0 postfix.aliasesdb-stamp\n</code></pre> <pre><code>docker container run -it \\\n  -v /var/log:/host/var/log:Z \\\n  fluentbit:latest\n</code></pre> <p>In Kubernetes, relabeling is slightly different. Rather than having Docker automatically relabel the files, you can specify a custom MCS label to run the pod. Volumes that support relabeling will automatically be relabeled so that they are accessible. Pods with a matching MCS label will be able to access the volume. If you need strict isolation, set a different MCS label for each pod.</p> <pre><code>securityContext:\n  seLinuxOptions:\n    # Provide a unique MCS label per container\n    # You can specify user, role, and type also\n    # enforcement based on type and level (svert)\n    level: s0:c144:c154\n</code></pre> <p>In this example <code>s0:c144:c154</code> corresponds to an MCS label assigned to a file that the container is allowed to access.</p> <p>On EKS you could create policies that allow for privileged containers to run, like FluentD and create an SELinux policy to allow it to read from /var/log on the host without needing to relabel the host directory.

Basic scanning leverages Clair an open source image scanning solution for no cost. Enhanced scanning uses Amazon Inspector to provide automatic continuous scans for additional cost. After an image is scanned, the results are logged to the event stream for ECR in EventBridge. You can also see the results of a scan from within the ECR console.

For this approach to work, we must repel pods from scheduling onto nodes for which the pods are not authorized. To repel unwanted or unauthorized pods, Kubernetes uses node taints. Taints are used to place conditions on nodes that prevent pods from being scheduled. The below taint uses a key-value pair of <code>tenant: tenants-x</code>.</p> <pre><code>...\n    taints:\n      - key: tenant\n        value: tenants-x\n        effect: NoSchedule\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Given the above node <code>taint</code>, only pods that tolerate the taint will be allowed to be scheduled on the node.

Examples of these pods are those started by the Container Network Interface (CNI) and kube-proxy daemonsets. To that end, the specifications for these pods contain very permissive tolerations, to tolerate different taints. Care should be taken to not change these tolerations. Changing these tolerations could result in incorrect cluster operation. Additionally, policy-management tools, such as OPA/Gatekeeper and Kyverno can be used to write validating policies that prevent unauthorized pods from using these permissive tolerations.</p>"},{"location":"security/docs/multitenancy/#part-3-policy-based-management-for-node-selection","title":"Part 3 - Policy-based management for node selection","text":"<p>There are several tools that can be used to help manage the node affinity and tolerations of pod specifications, including enforcement of rules in CICD pipelines. However, enforcement of isolation should also be done at the Kubernetes cluster level. For this purpose, policy-management tools can be used to mutate inbound Kubernetes API server requests, based on request payloads, to apply the respective node affinity rules and tolerations mentioned above.</p> <p>For example, pods destined for the tenants-x namespace can be stamped with the correct node affinity and toleration to permit scheduling on the tenants-x nodes. Utilizing policy-management tools configured using the Kubernetes Mutating Admission Webhook, policies can be used to mutate the inbound pod specifications. The mutations add the needed elements to allow desired scheduling. An example OPA/Gatekeeper policy that adds a node affinity is seen below.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1\nkind: Assign\nmetadata:\n  name: mutator-add-nodeaffinity-pod\n  annotations:\n    aws-eks-best-practices/description: &gt;-\n      Adds Node affinity - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity\nspec:\n  applyTo:\n  - groups: [\"\"]\n    kinds: [\"Pod\"]\n    versions: [\"v1\"]\n  match:\n    namespaces: [\"tenants-x\"]\n  location: \"spec.affinity.nodeAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution.nodeSelectorTerms\"\n  parameters:\n    assign:\n      value: \n        - matchExpressions:\n          - key: \"tenant\"\n            operator: In\n            values:\n            - \"tenants-x\"\n</code></pre> <p>The above policy is applied to a Kubernetes API server request, to apply a pod to the tenants-x namespace. The policy adds the <code>requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</code> node affinity rule, so that pods are attracted to nodes with the <code>tenant: tenants-x</code> label.</p> <p>A second policy, seen below, adds the toleration to the same pod specification, using the same matching criteria of target namespace and groups, kinds, and versions.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1\nkind: Assign\nmetadata:\n  name: mutator-add-toleration-pod\n  annotations:\n    aws-eks-best-practices/description: &gt;-\n      Adds toleration - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/\nspec:\n  applyTo:\n  - groups: [\"\"]\n    kinds: [\"Pod\"]\n    versions: [\"v1\"]\n  match:\n    namespaces: [\"tenants-x\"]\n  location: \"spec.tolerations\"\n  parameters:\n    assign:\n      value: \n      - key: \"tenant\"\n        operator: \"Equal\"\n        value: \"tenants-x\"\n        effect: \"NoSchedule\"\n</code></pre> <p>The above policies are specific to pods; this is due to the paths to the mutated elements in the policies' <code>location</code> elements. Additional policies could be written to handle resources that create pods, like Deployment and Job resources. The listed policies and other examples can been seen in the companion GitHub project for this guide.</p> <p>The result of these two mutations is that pods are attracted to the desired node, while at the same time, not repelled by the specific node taint. To verify this, we can see the snippets of output from two <code>kubectl</code> calls to get the nodes labeled with <code>tenant=tenants-x</code>, and get the pods in the <code>tenants-x</code> namespace.</p> <pre><code>kubectl get nodes -l tenant=tenants-x\nNAME                                        \nip-10-0-11-255...\nip-10-0-28-81...\nip-10-0-43-107...\n\nkubectl -n tenants-x get pods -owide\nNAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE\ntenant-test-deploy-58b895ff87-2q7xw   1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.42.143   ip-10-0-43-107...\ntenant-test-deploy-58b895ff87-9b6hg   1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.18.145   ip-10-0-28-81...\ntenant-test-deploy-58b895ff87-nxvw5   1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.30.117   ip-10-0-28-81...\ntenant-test-deploy-58b895ff87-vw796   1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.3.113    ip-10-0-11-255...\ntenant-test-pod                       1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.35.83    ip-10-0-43-107...\n</code></pre> <p>As we can see from the above outputs, all the pods are scheduled on the nodes labeled with <code>tenant=tenants-x</code>. Simply put, the pods will only run on the desired nodes, and the other pods (without the required affinity and tolerations) will not. The tenant workloads are effectively isolated.</p> <p>An example mutated pod specification is seen below.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: tenant-test-pod\n  namespace: tenants-x\nspec:\n  affinity:\n    nodeAffinity:\n      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n        nodeSelectorTerms:\n        - matchExpressions:\n          - key: tenant\n            operator: In\n            values:\n            - tenants-x\n...\n  tolerations:\n  - effect: NoSchedule\n    key: tenant\n    operator: Equal\n    value: tenants-x\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Attention</p> <p>Policy-management tools that are integrated to the Kubernetes API server request flow, using mutating and validating admission webhooks, are designed to respond to the API server's request within a specified timeframe. This is usually 3 seconds or less. If the webhook call fails to return a response within the configured time, the mutation and/or validation of the inbound API sever request may or may not occur. This behavior is based on whether the admission webhook configurations are set to Fail Open or Fail Close.</p> <p>In the above examples, we used policies written for OPA/Gatekeeper. However, there are other policy management tools that handle our node-selection use case as well. For example, this Kyverno policy could be used to handle the node affinity mutation.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If operating correctly, mutating policies will effect the desired changes to inbound API server request payloads. However, validating policies should also be included to verify that the desired changes occur, before changes are allowed to persist. This is especially important when using these policies for tenant-to-node isolation. It is also a good idea to include Audit policies to routinely check your cluster for unwanted configurations.</p>"},{"location":"security/docs/multitenancy/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li> <p>k-rail Designed to help you secure a multi-tenant environment through the enforcement of certain policies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security Practices for MultiTenant SaaS Applications using Amazon EKS</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"security/docs/multitenancy/#hard-multi-tenancy","title":"Hard multi-tenancy","text":"<p>Hard multi-tenancy can be implemented by provisioning separate clusters for each tenant.

Security groups are also used to control the traffic between worker nodes, and other VPC resources, and external IP addresses.  When you provision an EKS cluster (with Kubernetes version 1.14-eks.3 or greater), a cluster security group is automatically created for you.  This security group allows unfettered communication between the EKS control plane and the nodes from managed node groups. For simplicity, it is recommended that you add the cluster SG to all node groups, including unmanaged node groups.</p> <p>Prior to Kubernetes version 1.14 and EKS version eks.3, there were separate security groups configured for the EKS control plane and node groups. The minimum and suggested rules for the control plane and node group security groups can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html.  The minimum rules for the control plane security group allows port 443 inbound from the worker node SG. This rule is what allows the kubelets to communicate with the Kubernetes API server.  It also includes port 10250 for outbound traffic to the worker node SG; 10250 is the port that the kubelets listen on. Similarly, the minimum node group rules allow port 10250 inbound from the control plane SG and 443 outbound to the control plane SG.  Finally there is a rule that allows unfettered communication between nodes within a node group.</p> <p>If you need to control communication between services that run within the cluster and service the run outside the cluster such as an RDS database, consider security groups for pods. With security groups for pods, you can assign an existing security group to a collection of pods.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If you reference a security group that does not exist prior to the creation of the pods, the pods will not get scheduled.</p> <p>You can control which pods are assigned to a security group by creating a <code>SecurityGroupPolicy</code> object and specifying a <code>PodSelector</code> or a <code>ServiceAccountSelector</code>. Setting the selectors to <code>{}</code> will assign the SGs referenced in the <code>SecurityGroupPolicy</code> to all pods in a namespace or all Service Accounts in a namespace. Be sure you've familiarized yourself with all the considerations before implementing security groups for pods.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>If you use SGs for pods you must create SGs that allow port 53 outbound to the cluster security group.  Similarly, you must update the cluster security group to accept port 53 inbound traffic from the pod security group.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>The limits for security groups still apply when using security groups for pods so use them judiciously.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>You must create rules for inbound traffic from the cluster security group (kubelet) for all of the probes configured for pod.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>Security groups for pods relies on a feature known as ENI trunking which was created to increase the ENI density of an EC2 instance. When a pod is assigned to an SG, a VPC controller associates a branch ENI from the node group with the pod. If there aren't enough branch ENIs available in a node group at the time the pod is scheduled, the pod will stay in pending state. The number of branch ENIs an instance can support varies by instance type/family. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/security-groups-for-pods.html#supported-instance-types for further details.</p> <p>While security groups for pods offers an AWS-native way to control network traffic within and outside of your cluster without the overhead of a policy daemon, other options are available. For example, the Cilium policy engine allows you to reference a DNS name in a network policy. Calico Enterprise includes an option for mapping network policies to AWS security groups. If you've implemented a service mesh like Istio, you can use an egress gateway to restrict network egress to specific, fully qualified domains or IP addresses. For further information about this option, read the three part series on egress traffic control in Istio.</p>"},{"location":"security/docs/network/#when-to-use-network-policy-vs-security-group-for-pods","title":"When to use Network Policy vs Security Group for Pods?","text":""},{"location":"security/docs/network/#when-to-use-kubernetes-network-policy","title":"When to use Kubernetes network policy","text":"<ul> <li>Controlling pod-to-pod traffic</li> <li>Suitable for controlling network traffic between pods inside a cluster (east-west traffic)</li> <li>Control traffic at the IP address or port level (OSI layer 3 or 4)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"security/docs/network/#when-to-use-aws-security-groups-for-pods-sgp","title":"When to use AWS Security groups for pods (SGP)","text":"<ul> <li>Leverage existing AWS configurations</li> <li>If you already have complex set of EC2 security groups that manage access to AWS services and you are migrating applications from EC2 instances to EKS, SGPs can be a very good choice allowing you to reuse security group resources and apply them to your pods.</li> <li>Control access to AWS services</li> <li>Your applications running within an EKS cluster wants to communicate with other AWS services (RDS database), use SGPs as an efficient mechanism to control the traffic from the pods to AWS services.</li> <li>Isolation of Pod &amp; Node traffic</li> <li>If you want to completely separate pod traffic from the rest of the node traffic, use SGP in <code>POD_SECURITY_GROUP_ENFORCING_MODE=strict</code> mode.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"security/docs/network/#best-practices-using-security-groups-for-pods-and-network-policy","title":"Best practices using <code>Security groups for pods</code> and <code>Network Policy</code>","text":"<ul> <li>Layered security</li> <li>Use a combination of SGP and kubernetes network policy for a layered security approach</li> <li>Use SGPs to limit network level access to AWS services that are not part of a cluster, while kubernetes network policies can restrict network traffic between pods inside the cluster</li> <li>Principle of least privilege</li> <li>Only allow necessary traffic between pods or namespaces</li> <li>Segment your applications</li> <li>Wherever possible, segment applications by the network policy to reduce the blast radius if an application is compromised</li> <li>Keep policies simple and clear</li> <li>Kubernetes network policies can be quite granular and complex, its best to keep them as simple as possible to reduce the risk of misconfiguration and ease the management overhead</li> <li>Reduce the attack surface</li> <li>Minimize the attack surface by limiting the exposure of your applications</li> </ul> <p>Attention</p> <p>Security Groups for pods provides two enforcing modes: <code>strict</code> and <code>standard</code>.

The PSA effort includes an admission controller webhook project that implements the controls defined in the PSS. This admission controller approach resembles that used in the PAC solutions.</p> <p>According to the Kubernetes documentation, the PSS \"define three different policies to broadly cover the security spectrum. These policies are cumulative and range from highly-permissive to highly-restrictive.\"</p> <p>These policies are defined as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Privileged: Unrestricted (unsecure) policy, providing the widest possible level of permissions. This policy allows for known privilege escalations. It is the absence of a policy. This is good for applications such as logging agents, CNIs, storage drivers, and other system wide applications that need privileged access.</p> </li> <li> <p>Baseline: Minimally restrictive policy which prevents known privilege escalations. Allows the default (minimally specified) Pod configuration. The baseline policy prohibits use of hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC, hostPath, hostPort, the inability to add Linux capabilities, along with several other restrictions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Restricted: Heavily restricted policy, following current Pod hardening best practices.  This policy inherits from the baseline and adds further restrictions such as the inability to run as root or a root-group. Restricted policies may impact an application's ability to function. They are primarily targeted at running security critical applications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These policies define profiles for pod execution, arranged into three levels of privileged vs. restricted access.</p> <p>To implement the controls defined by the PSS, PSA operates in three modes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>enforce: Policy violations will cause the pod to be rejected.</p> </li> <li> <p>audit: Policy violations will trigger the addition of an audit annotation to the event recorded in the audit log, but are otherwise allowed.</p> </li> <li> <p>warn: Policy violations will trigger a user-facing warning, but are otherwise allowed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These modes and the profile (restriction) levels are configured at the Kubernetes Namespace level, using labels, as seen in the below example.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: policy-test\n  labels:\n    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted\n</code></pre> <p>When used independently, these operational modes have different responses that result in different user experiences. The enforce mode will prevent pods from being created if respective podSpecs violate the configured restriction level. However, in this mode, non-pod Kubernetes objects that create pods, such as Deployments, will not be prevented from being applied to the cluster, even if the podSpec therein violates the applied PSS. In this case the Deployment will be applied, while the pod(s) will be prevented from being applied.</p> <p>This is a difficult user experience, as there is no immediate indication that the successfully applied Deployment object belies failed pod creation. The offending podSpecs will not create pods. Inspecting the Deployment resource with <code>kubectl get deploy &lt;DEPLOYMENT_NAME&gt; -oyaml</code> will expose the message from the failed pod(s) <code>.status.conditions</code> element, as seen below.</p> <pre><code>...\nstatus:\n  conditions:\n    - lastTransitionTime: \"2022-01-20T01:02:08Z\"\n      lastUpdateTime: \"2022-01-20T01:02:08Z\"\n      message: 'pods \"test-688f68dc87-tw587\" is forbidden: violates PodSecurity \"restricted:latest\":\n        allowPrivilegeEscalation != false (container \"test\" must set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false),\n        unrestricted capabilities (container \"test\" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=[\"ALL\"]),\n        runAsNonRoot != true (pod or container \"test\" must set securityContext.runAsNonRoot=true),\n        seccompProfile (pod or container \"test\" must set securityContext.seccompProfile.type\n        to \"RuntimeDefault\" or \"Localhost\")'\n      reason: FailedCreate\n      status: \"True\"\n      type: ReplicaFailure\n...\n</code></pre> <p>In both the audit and warn modes, the pod restrictions do not prevent violating pods from being created and started. However, in these modes audit annotations on API server audit log events and warnings to API server clients, such as kubectl, are triggered, respectively, when pods, as well as objects that create pods, contain podSpecs with violations. A <code>kubectl</code> Warning message is seen below.</p> <pre><code>Warning: would violate PodSecurity \"restricted:latest\": allowPrivilegeEscalation != false (container \"test\" must set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false), unrestricted capabilities (container \"test\" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=[\"ALL\"]), runAsNonRoot != true (pod or container \"test\" must set securityContext.runAsNonRoot=true), seccompProfile (pod or container \"test\" must set securityContext.seccompProfile.type to \"RuntimeDefault\" or \"Localhost\")\ndeployment.apps/test created\n</code></pre> <p>The PSA audit and warn modes are useful when introducing the PSS without negatively impacting cluster operations.</p> <p>The PSA operational modes are not mutually exclusive, and can be used in a cumulative manner. As seen below, the multiple modes can be configured in a single namespace.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: policy-test\n  labels:\n    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted\n    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted\n    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, the user-friendly warnings and audit annotations are provided when applying Deployments, while the enforce of violations are also provided at the pod level. In fact multiple PSA labels can use different profile levels, as seen below.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: policy-test\n  labels:\n    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: baseline\n    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, PSA is configured to allow the creation of all pods that satisfy the baseline profile level, and then warn on pods (and objects that create pods) that violate the restricted profile level.

As additional pods are scheduled onto a node, the node may experience CPU or memory pressure which can cause the Kubelet to terminate or evict pods from the node.  While you can't prevent this from happening all together, setting requests and limits will help minimize resource contention and mitigate the risk from poorly written applications that consume an excessive amount of resources.</p> <p>The <code>podSpec</code> allows you to specify requests and limits for CPU and memory.  CPU is considered a compressible resource because it can be oversubscribed.  Memory is incompressible, i.e. it cannot be shared among multiple containers.  </p> <p>When you specify requests for CPU or memory, you're essentially designating the amount of memory that containers are guaranteed to get.  Kubernetes aggregates the requests of all the containers in a pod to determine which node to schedule the pod onto.  If a container exceeds the requested amount of memory it may be subject to termination if there's memory pressure on the node.</p> <p>Limits are the maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that a container is allowed to consume and directly corresponds to the <code>memory.limit_in_bytes</code> value of the cgroup created for the container.  A container that exceeds the memory limit will be OOM killed. If a container exceeds its CPU limit, it will be throttled.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>When using container <code>resources.limits</code> it is strongly recommended that container resource usage (a.k.a. Resource Footprints) be data-driven and accurate, based on load testing. Absent an accurate and trusted resource footprint, container <code>resources.limits</code> can be padded. For example, <code>resources.limits.memory</code> could be padded 20-30% higher than observable maximums, to account for potential memory resource limit inaccuracies.</p> <p>Kubernetes uses three Quality of Service (QoS) classes to prioritize the workloads running on a node.  These include:</p> <ul> <li>guaranteed</li> <li>burstable</li> <li>best-effort</li> </ul> <p>If limits and requests are not set, the pod is configured as best-effort (lowest priority).  Best-effort pods are the first to get killed when there is insufficient memory.  If limits are set on all containers within the pod, or if the requests and limits are set to the same values and not equal to 0, the pod is configured as guaranteed (highest priority).  Guaranteed pods will not be killed unless they exceed their configured memory limits. If the limits and requests are configured with different values and not equal to 0, or one container within the pod sets limits and the others don't or have limits set for different resources, the pods are configured as burstable (medium priority). These pods have some resource guarantees, but can be killed once they exceed their requested memory.</p> <p>Attention</p> <p>Requests don't affect the <code>memory_limit_in_bytes</code> value of the container's cgroup; the cgroup limit is set to the amount of memory available on the host.

A resource quota allows you to specify the total amount of resources, e.g. CPU and RAM, allocated to a namespace.  When it's applied to a namespace, it forces you to specify requests and limits for all containers deployed into that namespace. By contrast, limit ranges give you more granular control of the allocation of resources. With limit ranges you can min/max for CPU and memory resources per pod or per container within a namespace.

Prometheus collects metrics around containers, pods, nodes, and clusters. Additionally, Prometheus leverages AlertsManager which lets you program alerts to warn you if something in your cluster is going wrong. Prometheus stores the metric data as a time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs. Prometheus includes away to query using a language called PromQL, which is short for Prometheus Query Language. </p> <p>The high level architecture of Prometheus metrics collection is shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>Prometheus uses a pull mechanism and scrapes metrics from targets using exporters and from the Kubernetes API using the kube state metrics. This means applications and services must expose a HTTP(S) endpoint containing Prometheus formatted metrics. Prometheus will then, as per its configuration, periodically pull metrics from these HTTP(S) endpoints.</p> <p>An exporter lets you consume third party metrics as Prometheus formatted metrics. A Prometheus exporter is typically deployed on each node. For a complete list of exporters please refer to the Prometheus exporters. While node exporter is suited for exporting host hardware and OS metrics for linux nodes, it wont work for Windows nodes. </p> <p>In a mixed node EKS cluster with Windows nodes when you use the stable Prometheus helm chart, you will see failed pods on the Windows nodes, as this exporter is not intended for Windows. You will need to treat the Windows worker pool separate and instead install the Windows exporter on the Windows worker node group. </p> <p>In order to setup Prometheus monitoring for Windows nodes, you need to download and install the WMI exporter on the Windows server itself and then setup the targets inside the scrape configuration of the Prometheus configuration file. The releases page provides all available .msi installers, with respective feature sets and bug fixes. The installer will setup the windows_exporter as a Windows service, as well as create an exception in the Windows firewall. If the installer is run without any parameters, the exporter will run with default settings for enabled collectors, ports, etc.</p> <p>You can check out the scheduling best practices section of this guide which suggests the use of taints/tolerations or RuntimeClass to selectively deploy node exporter only to linux nodes, while the Windows exporter is installed on Windows nodes as you bootstrap the node or using a configuration management tool of your choice (example chef, Ansible, SSM etc).</p> <p>Note that, unlike the linux nodes where the node exporter is installed as a daemonset , on Windows nodes the WMI exporter is installed on the host itself. The exporter will export metrics such as the CPU usage, the memory and the disk I/O usage and can also be used to monitor IIS sites and applications, the network interfaces and services. </p> <p>The windows_exporter will expose all metrics from enabled collectors by default. This is the recommended way to collect metrics to avoid errors. However, for advanced use the windows_exporter can be passed an optional list of collectors to filter metrics.

Linux containers use Linux constructs like namespaces, the union file system, and cgroups. On Windows, those constructs are abstracted from containerd by the Host Compute Service (HCS). HCS acts as an API layer that sits above the container implementation on Windows. Windows containers also leverage the Host Network Service (HNS) that defines the network topology on a node. </p> <p></p> <p>From a networking perspective, HCS and HNS make Windows containers function like virtual machines. For example, each container has a virtual network adapter (vNIC) that is connected to a Hyper-V virtual switch (vSwitch) as shown in the diagram above.</p>"},{"location":"windows/docs/networking/#ip-address-management","title":"IP Address Management","text":"<p>A node in Amazon EKS uses it's Elastic Network Interface (ENI) to connect to an AWS VPC network. Presently, only a single ENI per Windows worker node is supported. The IP address management for Windows nodes is performed by VPC Resource Controller which runs in control plane. More details about the workflow for IP address management of Windows nodes can be found here.</p> <p>The number of pods that a Windows worker node can support is dictated by the size of the node and the number of available IPv4 addresses. You can calculate the IPv4 address available on the node as below: - By default, only secondary IPv4 addresses are assigned to the ENI. In such a case:   <pre><code>Total IPv4 addresses available for Pods = Number of supported IPv4 addresses in the primary interface - 1\n</code></pre>   We subtract one from the total count since one IPv4 addresses will be used as the primary address of the ENI and hence cannot be allocated to the Pods.</p> <ul> <li>If the cluster has been configured for high pod density by enabling prefix delegation feature then-   <pre><code>Total IPv4 addresses available for Pods = (Number of supported IPv4 addresses in the primary interface - 1) * 16\n</code></pre>   Here, instead of allocating secondary IPv4 addresses, VPC Resource Controller will allocate <code>/28 prefixes</code> and therefore, the overall number of available IPv4 addresses will be boosted 16 times.</li> </ul> <p>Using the formula above, we can calculate max pods for an Windows worker noded based on a m5.large instance as below: - By default, when running in secondary IP mode-   <pre><code>10 secondary IPv4 addresses per ENI - 1 = 9 available IPv4 addresses\n</code></pre> - When using <code>prefix delegation</code>-   <pre><code>(10 secondary IPv4 addresses per ENI - 1) * 16 = 144 available IPv4 addresses\n</code></pre></p> <p>For more information on how many IP addresses an instance type can support, see IP addresses per network interface per instance type. </p> <p>Another key consideration is the flow of network traffic. With Windows there is a risk of port exhaustion on nodes with more than 100 services. When this condition arises, the nodes will start throwing errors with the following message:</p> <p>\"Policy creation failed: hcnCreateLoadBalancer failed in Win32: The specified port already exists.\"</p> <p>To address this issue, we leverage Direct Server Return (DSR). DSR is an implementation of asymmetric network load distribution. In other words, the request and response traffic use different network paths. This feature speeds up communication between pods and reduces the risk of port exhaustion. We therefore recommend enabling DSR on Windows nodes. </p> <p>DSR is enabled by default in Windows Server SAC EKS Optimized AMIs. For Windows Server 2019 LTSC EKS Optimized AMIs, you will need to enable it during instance provisioning using the script below and by using Windows Server 2019 Full or Core as the amiFamily in the <code>eksctl</code> nodeGroup. See eksctl custom AMI for additional information. </p> <p><pre><code>nodeGroups:\n- name: windows-ng\n  instanceType: c5.xlarge\n  minSize: 1\n  volumeSize: 50\n  amiFamily: WindowsServer2019CoreContainer\n  ssh:\n    allow: false\n</code></pre> In order to utilize DSR in Windows Server 2019 and above, you will need to specify the following kube-proxy flags during instance startup.  You can do this by adjusting the userdata script associated with the self-managed node groups Launch Template.</p> <pre><code>&lt;powershell&gt;\n[string]$EKSBinDir = \"$env:ProgramFiles\\Amazon\\EKS\"\n[string]$EKSBootstrapScriptName = 'Start-EKSBootstrap.ps1'\n[string]$EKSBootstrapScriptFile = \"$EKSBinDir\\$EKSBootstrapScriptName\"\n(Get-Content $EKSBootstrapScriptFile).replace('\"--proxy-mode=kernelspace\",', '\"--proxy-mode=kernelspace\", \"--feature-gates WinDSR=true\", \"--enable-dsr\",') | Set-Content $EKSBootstrapScriptFile \n&amp; $EKSBootstrapScriptFile -EKSClusterName \"eks-windows\" -APIServerEndpoint \"https://&lt;REPLACE-EKS-CLUSTER-CONFIG-API-SERVER&gt;\" -Base64ClusterCA \"&lt;REPLACE-EKSCLUSTER-CONFIG-DETAILS-CA&gt;\" -DNSClusterIP \"172.20.0.10\" -KubeletExtraArgs \"--node-labels=alpha.eksctl.io/cluster-name=eks-windows,alpha.eksctl.io/nodegroup-name=windows-ng-ltsc2019 --register-with-taints=\" 3&gt;&amp;1 4&gt;&amp;1 5&gt;&amp;1 6&gt;&amp;1\n&lt;/powershell&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>DSR enablement can be verified following the instructions in the Microsoft Networking blog and the Windows Containers on AWS Lab.</p> <p></p> <p>If preserving your available IPv4 addresses and minimizing wastage is crucial for your subnet, it is generally recommended to avoid using prefix delegation mode as mentioned in Prefix Mode for Windows - When to avoid. If using prefix delegation is still desired, you can take steps to optimize IPv4 address utilization in your subnet. See Configuring Parameters for Prefix Delegation for detailed instructions on how to fine-tune the IPv4 address request and allocation process. Adjusting these configurations can help you strike a balance between conserving IPv4 addresses and pod density benefits of prefix delegation.</p> <p>When using the default setting of assigning secondary IPv4 addresses, there are currently no supported configurations to manipulate how the VPC Resource Controller requests and allocates IPv4 addresses. More specifically, <code>minimum-ip-target</code> and <code>warm-ip-target</code> are only supported for prefix delegation mode. Also take note that in secondary IP mode, depending on the available IP addresses on the interface, the VPC Resource Controller will typically allocate 3 unused IPv4 addresses on the node on your behalf to maintain warm IPs for faster pod startup times. If you would like to minimize IP wastage of unused warm IP addresses, you could aim to schedule more pods on a given Windows node such that you use as much IP address capacity of the ENI as possible. More explicitly, you could avoid having warm unused IPs if all IP addresses on the ENI are already in use by the node and running pods. Another workaround to help you resolve constraints with IP address availability in your subnet(s) could be to explore increasing your subnet size or separating your Windows nodes into their own dedicated subnets.</p> <p>Additionally, it's important to note that IPv6 is not supported on Windows nodes at the moment.</p>"},{"location":"windows/docs/networking/#container-network-interface-cni-options","title":"Container Network Interface (CNI) options","text":"<p>The AWSVPC CNI is the de facto CNI plugin for Windows and Linux worker nodes.

Note that PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated as of Kubernetes v1.21, and will be removed in v1.25 and Pod Security Standard (PSS) is the Kubernetes recommended approach for enforcing security going forward.</p> <p>A Pod Security Policy (PSP) is a native solution in Kubernetes to implement security policies. PSP is a cluster-level resource that controls security-sensitive aspects of the Pod specification. Using Pod Security Policy you can define a set of conditions that Pods must meet to be accepted by the cluster. The PSP feature has been available from the early days of Kubernetes and is designed to block misconfigured pods from being created on a given cluster.</p> <p>For more information on Pod Security Policies please reference the Kubernetes documentation. According to the Kubernetes deprecation policy, older versions will stop getting support nine months after the deprecation of the feature.</p> <p>On the other hand, Pod Security Standards (PSS) which is the recommended security approach and typically implemented using Security Contexts are defined as part of the Pod and container specifications in the Pod manifest. PSS is the official standard that the Kubernetes project team has defined to address the security-related best practices for Pods. It defines policies such as baseline (minimally restrictive, default), privileged (unrestrictive) and restricted (most restrictive).</p> <p>We recommend starting with the baseline profile. PSS baseline profile provides a solid balance between security and potential friction, requiring a minimal list of exceptions, it serves as a good starting point for workload security. If you are currently using PSPs we recommend switching to PSS. More details on the PSS policies can be found in the Kubernetes documentation. These policies can be enforced with several tools including those from OPA and Kyverno. For example, Kyverno provides the full collection of PSS policies here.</p> <p>Security context settings allow one to give privileges to select processes, use program profiles to restrict capabilities to individual programs, allow privilege escalation, filter system calls, among other things.</p> <p>Windows pods in Kubernetes have some limitations and differentiators from standard Linux-based workloads when it comes to security contexts.</p> <p>Windows uses a Job object per container with a system namespace filter to contain all processes in a container and provide logical isolation from the host. There is no way to run a Windows container without the namespace filtering in place. This means that system privileges cannot be asserted in the context of the host, and thus privileged containers are not available on Windows.</p> <p>The following <code>windowsOptions</code> are the only documented Windows Security Context options while the rest are general Security Context options</p> <p>For a list of security context attributes that are supported in Windows vs linux, please refer to the official documentation here.</p> <p>The Pod specific settings are applied to all containers. If unspecified, the options from the PodSecurityContext will be used. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.</p> <p>For example, runAsUserName setting for Pods and containers which is a Windows option is a rough equivalent of the Linux-specific runAsUser setting and in the following manifest, the pod specific security context is applied to all containers</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: run-as-username-pod-demo\nspec:\n  securityContext:\n    windowsOptions:\n      runAsUserName: \"ContainerUser\"\n  containers:\n  - name: run-as-username-demo\n    ...\n  nodeSelector:\n    kubernetes.io/os: windows\n</code></pre> <p>Whereas in the following, the container level security context overrides the pod level security context.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: run-as-username-container-demo\nspec:\n  securityContext:\n    windowsOptions:\n      runAsUserName: \"ContainerUser\"\n  containers:\n  - name: run-as-username-demo\n    ..\n    securityContext:\n        windowsOptions:\n            runAsUserName: \"ContainerAdministrator\"\n  nodeSelector:\n    kubernetes.io/os: windows\n</code></pre> <p>Examples of acceptable values for the runAsUserName field: ContainerAdministrator, ContainerUser, NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE, NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE</p> <p>It is generally a good idea to run your containers with ContainerUser for Windows pods. The users are not shared between the container and host but the ContainerAdministrator does have additional privileges with in the container. Note that, there are username limitations to be aware of.</p> <p>A good example of when to use ContainerAdministrator is to set PATH. You can use the USER directive to do that, like so:</p> <pre><code>USER ContainerAdministrator\nRUN setx /M PATH \"%PATH%;C:/your/path\"\nUSER ContainerUser\n</code></pre> <p>Also note that, secrets are written in clear text on the node's volume (as compared to tmpfs/in-memory on linux). This means you have to do two things</p> <ul> <li>Use file ACLs to secure the secrets file location</li> <li>Use volume-level encryption using BitLocker</li> </ul>"},{"location":"windows/docs/storage/","title":"Storage Options","text":"<p>We've Moved to the AWS Docs! \ud83d\ude80</p> <p>This content has been updated and relocated to improve your experience.

This meant that adding a new storage system to Kubernetes (a volume plugin) required checking code into the core Kubernetes code repository.</p> <p>Out-of-tree volume plugins are developed independently of the Kubernetes code base, and are deployed (installed) on Kubernetes clusters as extensions. This gives vendors the ability to update drivers out-of-band, i.e. separately from the Kubernetes release cycle. This is largely possible because Kubernetes has created a storage interface or CSI that provides vendors a standard way of interfacing with k8s. </p> <p>You can check more about Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS) storage classes and CSI Drivers on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/storage.html</p>"},{"location":"windows/docs/storage/#in-tree-volume-plugin-for-windows","title":"In-tree Volume Plugin for Windows","text":"<p>Kubernetes volumes enable applications, with data persistence requirements, to be deployed on Kubernetes. The management of persistent volumes consists of provisioning/de-provisioning/resizing of volumes, attaching/detaching a volume to/from a Kubernetes node, and mounting/dismounting a volume to/from individual containers in a pod. The code for implementing these volume management actions for a specific storage back-end or protocol is shipped in the form of a Kubernetes volume plugin (In-tree Volume Plugins). On Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS) the following class of Kubernetes volume plugins are supported on Windows:</p> <p>In-tree Volume Plugin: awsElasticBlockStore</p> <p>In order to use In-tree volume plugin on Windows nodes, it is necessary to create an additional StorageClass to use NTFS as the fsType. On EKS, the default StorageClass uses ext4 as the default fsType. </p> <p>A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the \"classes\" of storage they offer. Different classes might map to quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or arbitrary policies determined by the cluster administrators. Kubernetes is unopinionated about what classes represent. This concept is sometimes called \"profiles\" in other storage systems.</p> <p>You can check it by running the following command:</p> <pre><code>kubectl describe storageclass gp2\n</code></pre> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code>Name:            gp2\nIsDefaultClass:  Yes\nAnnotations:     kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration={\"apiVersion\":\"storage.k8s.io/v1\",\"kind\":\"StorageClas\n\",\"metadata\":{\"annotations\":{\"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class\":\"true\"},\"name\":\"gp2\"},\"parameters\":{\"fsType\"\n\"ext4\",\"type\":\"gp2\"},\"provisioner\":\"kubernetes.io/aws-ebs\",\"volumeBindingMode\":\"WaitForFirstConsumer\"}\n,storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true\nProvisioner:           kubernetes.io/aws-ebs\nParameters:            fsType=ext4,type=gp2\nAllowVolumeExpansion:  &lt;unset&gt;\nMountOptions:          &lt;none&gt;\nReclaimPolicy:         Delete\nVolumeBindingMode:     WaitForFirstConsumer\nEvents:                &lt;none&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>To create the new StorageClass to support NTFS, use the following manifest:</p> <pre><code>kind: StorageClass\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: gp2-windows\nprovisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs\nparameters:\n  type: gp2\n  fsType: ntfs\nvolumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer\n</code></pre> <p>Create the StorageClass by running the following command:</p> <pre><code>kubectl apply -f NTFSStorageClass.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>The next step is to create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).</p> <p>A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using PVC. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.</p> <p>A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or ReadWriteMany).</p> <p>Users need PersistentVolumes with different attributes, such as performance, for different use cases. Cluster administrators need to be able to offer a variety of PersistentVolumes that differ in more ways than just size and access modes, without exposing users to the details of how those volumes are implemented. For these needs, there is the StorageClass resource.</p> <p>In the example below, the PVC has been created within the namespace windows.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: ebs-windows-pv-claim\n  namespace: windows\nspec: \n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  storageClassName: gp2-windows\n  resources: \n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n</code></pre> <p>Create the PVC by running the following command:</p> <pre><code>kubectl apply -f persistent-volume-claim.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>The following manifest creates a Windows Pod, setup the VolumeMount as <code>C:\\Data</code> and uses the PVC as the attached storage on <code>C:\\Data</code>. </p> <pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: windows-server-ltsc2019\n  namespace: windows\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: windows-server-ltsc2019\n      tier: backend\n      track: stable\n  replicas: 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: windows-server-ltsc2019\n        tier: backend\n        track: stable\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: windows-server-ltsc2019\n        image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019\n        ports:\n        - name: http\n          containerPort: 80\n        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n        volumeMounts:\n        - mountPath: \"C:\\\\data\"\n          name: test-volume\n      volumes:\n        - name: test-volume\n          persistentVolumeClaim:\n            claimName: ebs-windows-pv-claim\n      nodeSelector:\n        kubernetes.io/os: windows\n        node.kubernetes.io/windows-build: '10.0.17763'\n</code></pre> <p>Test the results by accessing the Windows pod via PowerShell:</p> <pre><code>kubectl exec -it podname powershell -n windows\n</code></pre> <p>Inside the Windows Pod, run: <code>ls</code></p> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code>PS C:\\&gt; ls\n\n\n    Directory: C:\\\n\n\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\n----                 -------------         ------ ----\nd-----          3/8/2021   1:54 PM                data\nd-----          3/8/2021   3:37 PM                inetpub\nd-r---          1/9/2021   7:26 AM                Program Files\nd-----          1/9/2021   7:18 AM                Program Files (x86)\nd-r---          1/9/2021   7:28 AM                Users\nd-----          3/8/2021   3:36 PM                var\nd-----          3/8/2021   3:36 PM                Windows\n-a----         12/7/2019   4:20 AM           5510 License.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The data directory is provided by the EBS volume.</p>"},{"location":"windows/docs/storage/#out-of-tree-for-windows","title":"Out-of-tree for Windows","text":"<p>Code associated with CSI plugins ship as out-of-tree scripts and binaries that are typically distributed as container images and deployed using standard Kubernetes constructs like DaemonSets and StatefulSets.
